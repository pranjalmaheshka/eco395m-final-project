He has so much heart and cares about regular folks. And when not being forced to speak in quick soundbytes, his campaign did well combatting political narratives.   I hope he goes far. And makes a swift recovery so the skeptical can see him the way we do.",410

yqa3cg,"John Fetterman wins Pennsylvania Senate race, defeating TV doctor Mehmet Oz and flipping key state for Democrats","Do not let this momentum down. Do not let the next two years or any comfort returning to our systems allow you to forget or grow complacent. Keep up with knowing and contacting your current leaders as well as any prospectives for the next election. It is the people who must protect democracy and freedom above all, even if our institutions fail. The Supreme Court is still stacked illegitimately.   We must remain vigilant. We must not forget that politics cannot be turned off for so many that the democrats are allies towards (due to race, sexuality, relationships, gender, identity, and so much more). We must not forget that the past eight years since Trump picked up his vulgar campaigns has exposed the rot in our country and the outright danger these groups that cannot turn off politics are in from their own neighbors. KKK resurgences in rural communities, nazi proud boy torch marches, protestors being plowed through where a woman was killed, violences against people specifically targetted for their race, immigration status, sexuality, or religion. And of course January 6th.  We must never forget if we want our country to withstand the next two decades, let alone trying to envision it in the next century.",35

PA's state legislative districts are gerrymandered to hell and republicans basically have total control over which laws get sent to the governor's desk to sign. Had Mastriano won, the republican party would have had free reign to pass all the worst laws you've seen from states like Texas and Florida. Abortion would have been banned immediately. Mail in voting would have been banned immediately. Anti-trans bathroom bills would be passed. ""Don't say gay"" laws.

Since 2020 millennials are now the largest working age cohort. Across the economy I think we’ve seen many a boomer retire over the last 10 years. That’s closing out this decade. Actual attrition (deaths) varies of course based on health. Many retirees are reliable at the polls and they skew to one particular party. Degeneration and attrition though are on the horizon for that cohort.,14

In any other state outside of New England they'd probably be Democrats.",12
yvjde7,Democrat Katie Hobbs defeats MAGA favorite Kari Lake in high-stakes race for governor in Arizona,"I think Charlie would've run again if politics hadn't become such a clusterfuck in the last 4 years. He clearly realized it wasn't worth it for his own mental health to try and jump through the hoops required now to try and be a moderate Republican. He probably would've safely won, too.

yvjde7,Democrat Katie Hobbs defeats MAGA favorite Kari Lake in high-stakes race for governor in Arizona,"Wouldn't be surpised if he runs in 2024. He was the most popular governor according to approval ratings. He says he isn't, but he could be a great normal pick for Republicans.",7
yvjde7,Democrat Katie Hobbs defeats MAGA favorite Kari Lake in high-stakes race for governor in Arizona,"I truly believe Baker would've won this election easily, had he run again. Most people here really like him.   I honestly don't understand what the MA GOP was thinking running Geoff Diehl - they may as well have served the governership to the Dems on a silver platter. Diehl was a typical MAGA type, endorsed by Trump - basically, a far cry from the usual moderate RINO governer that the otherwise-very-blue Massachusetts likes to elect. It's really no surprise that he lost spectacularly to Healey.",181
yvjde7,Democrat Katie Hobbs defeats MAGA favorite Kari Lake in high-stakes race for governor in Arizona,Baker was re-elected in 2018 in a fucking landslide even during the Trump presidency. He would have crushed this cycle even against Healy.,17
yvjde7,Democrat Katie Hobbs defeats MAGA favorite Kari Lake in high-stakes race for governor in Arizona,"It's kind of sad really when you think about how Massachusetts is known as a blue state BUT, we tend to churn out some of the most left-leaning GOP candidates... with some exceptions just like everyone else.   Just like a lot of other states this cycle, we were primed to vote blue wholesale for a lot of reasons (mostly abortion from my talking to folks around my town).",13
yvjde7,Democrat Katie Hobbs defeats MAGA favorite Kari Lake in high-stakes race for governor in Arizona,Baker wasn't running again. He may have won again if he did. Diehl is a Trump nut so there was no chance he would beat our extremely popular Attorney General.,10

But this is MA!  lol, western counties would've voted red, but even then...",12

yvjde7,Democrat Katie Hobbs defeats MAGA favorite Kari Lake in high-stakes race for governor in Arizona,Is it really though? AZ was a red state in presidental elections with the exception of Biden and Clinton they voted mostly Republican since the 50s. Their governors have been 50/50. The fact its shifting blue in general is a good thing even if it's just slight margins for now. It's even better considering that this was supposed to be a Red Wave with how our economy is doing and inflation yet it did not happen. Republicans had every single  election state and national that weren't heavily Democrat leaning handed to them on a Sliver platter for the taking and they fumbled that bag wanting a turd on a golden Trump plate.,160
yvjde7,Democrat Katie Hobbs defeats MAGA favorite Kari Lake in high-stakes race for governor in Arizona,"That's why every single democratic that won a race needs to push hard for voting rights. The GOP wins buy suppressing votes, so they only way to really progress is to protect voting rights.",9

Foreign wars on places without McDonald’s make money. Civil war does not. Wealthy folk are perfectly okay making their money off cheap labor the normal way. Only grifters stand to make any money off something as dumb as election-denial. Jeff Besos wants to know more people are signing up for Amazon next quarter. Not that the politician he’s backing might get hunted by a mob and spiral the country into civil war. When you’re already winning at life, why would you want to potentially shake things up when your status, money, and power are practically imaginary and only exist because people abide to the status quo. Denying elections is the opposite. If this wasn’t/isn’t naturally squashed by democracy, the wealthy are gonna spend a lot of money reinforcing this semi-democracy before everyone decides to stop playing by the rules. It’s like winning at monopoly. If you piss everyone off, or start making up rules, and everyone decides to stop playing with you, your Monopoly money is now worth less than the paper it’s printed on.",9

yvjde7,Democrat Katie Hobbs defeats MAGA favorite Kari Lake in high-stakes race for governor in Arizona,"You're confusing your exposure with that of local az residents. Complicating this is the pull out of national republican ad spending from that campaign. Drawing conclusions from that race and extrapolating them onto the gov race is just as wrong as drawing conclusions from Hobbs not debating. Frankly hobbs is just not a good campaigner. She isn't a good speaker. Kari lake is a fucking lunatic with years of nearly daily media appearances.   I remember back in 2020 when I saw this competent woman thrust into this absolutely insane national spotlight due to these fucking lunatic Republicans and she was just like ""sorry I'm just gonna count the votes"". She is good at her job, she just isn't good at campaigning especially when shit is hitting the fan. Im grateful she will be in the position she is in now.",8

I think the shift blue we are seeing is more of a rebuke to MAGA and election denialism. Any traditionally conservative republican still wins hands down in AZ. Now that we have seen how bad election deniers have done across the country in general, my guess is we will see the pivot away from extreme MAGA republican candidates, like Kari Lake.

Republicans were working on voting restrictions before MAGA. They just weren't  denying election results and standing at polling places with machine guns.  Democrats will still need to win by larger than necessary margins because the GOP will work (more politely) to squeeze the process in its favor.  The good news is that Democrats have shown they can do that.  The Roe decision absolutely wasn't a product of MAGA, but it will animate younger voters, moderates, independents and particularly women for years. This election was not a one cycle statement.",8

They've tasted victory with red meat candidates and don't want to compromise with generic corporate Republicans again.   If Trump gets the nomination, you're going to push away the same independents that fled in 2018, 2020 and now 2022. If Trump gets defeated in the primary, then you're going to alienate the MAGA that you needed to win in 2016.

Lots of gen Z is still in school they desperately want gen Z to be non progressive. Desantis is 44 he'll be alive and well in 20 years. He could live and be active in politics even when he's old as trump. (76 so around 32 years from now) kids not even born yet will be old enough to vote against him by then.

Yes, she faced the same issues that minority women face every time they run. That is only part of the story, especially because she has shown she can overcome that and over perform in her previous matchup with Kemp. She lost because she failed to realize that the message she had been pushing for the last four years stopped being meaningful to voters nearly two years ago - and quite frankly I'm not sure how effective it ever was. I agree with you, it was an entirely reasonable message, but beyond it no longer being relevant after Kemp stood up to Trump, it gives major ""sore looser"" vibes to make your entire platform ""my opponent cheated me last time"". Again, I agree with it, but ultimately I don't think it would have continued resonating with independents even if Kemp hadnt stuck up to Trump.",21

I watched 10 minutes of the debate with Walker and Warnock did a good intro about his Christian upbringing and lowering insulin costs for people with diabetes.  Walker started off okay, talking about religion and his desire to reduce inflation but then went off on a tangent and said that people with diabetes need to stop eating so much…  If you want to win in a red state like Georgia you need to give people a reason to vote for you.  Warnock understands this but I am not so sure about Abrams, she focused her career on Georgia voting laws which half of Georgians do not care about.  A problem with a lot of democratic candidates in red states is that, while they are good at talking to their base, they aren’t good at talking with moderates.  They become minority centric, women centric, or single issue candidates whereas the Republicans have a whole machine around pushing issues like right to life or the economy.",15

Circling back to my main point tho, the GOP don’t actually know what they’re doing and they’re lazy, which is also why, when Trump came onto the scene, they were like, oh hell yes, now we *really* don’t have to do shit. This fool is gonna do all our jobs during this campaign (against a *very* good opponent, one they knew they’d have a very hard time beating), so they welcomed that shit, because they’re lazy, and all they care about is [not legislating] taking your money through reductions in corporate tax rates/increased incentives, and denying us access to programs and securities that we already paid for.

Biden is a much better president now than he would have been if he was elected in 2008. Who knows maybe Gravel played a part in making sure he didn't win the primaries.  edit: Gravel's contempt for Hillary Clinton was amazing. Besides calling her out for hinting she'd consider nukes, after he was no longer invited to debates because of his performance in the primaries, he hosted an event where he commented on the debates between her and obama. His legendary line about Clinton, ""Hillary, your lips are moving and you're lying"" still tickles me.  I think we need more people willing to call politicians out and make them uncomfortable.  edit2: The video you linked reminded me that Gravel was actually a pioneer of using social media (I guess youtube at the time wasn't considered social media) and other budding internet services to supplement his campaign.

The whole Trump episode has me jaded about the state of our nation. Though really he's just a product of right wing politics over the last, really, over 50 years.

He says whatever he believes people will respond best to, without any regard for if it is completely false, incidentally true, substantially true, or even classified information.

If of sound mind and no previous criminal history I should be able to own firearms. I should be able to own firearms that aren't limited to arbitrary capacity limits. I should be able to own firearms with all the tacticool attachments if I decide to for out the money for them. Fully automatic weapons? I am totally fine with not having access to them. Being stuck with a handgun that has a fewer than 10 rd capacity? That annoys me to no end.      I fully support more intensive background checks. I support a licensing registry. Psychological evals being a requirement for purchase and ownership although the ins and outs of that are more iffy than the others. ""Red Flag"" laws in the right capacity and use could save lives. Charges with a violent offense, especially a domestic? We are gonna hold onto your firearms until your case is over. Hell I would go so far as to even say if you have a divorce proceeding ongoing you should be mandated to go through a full evaluation to see if you should be able to keep your weapons. Do some of these seem draconian to hard 2nd amendment backers? Sure they do. Will they work? Absolutely.     Every time a GOP person says it's a mental health issue and conversely a democrat says ""guns can't be used to fight tyranny"" I can't help but facepalm though my fucking skull. GOP won't increase funding for mental health and the dems are just trying to attack a feels argument. Personal defense wise firearms are great to have. I have a right as a human being to be able to defend myself. Whether physical disabilities cause someone not to be able to physically fight or in the case of women at times the sheer gap in physicality that exists between them and men, some people need an equalizer.      The thing the Dems/Left have over the GOP mainly is they want to make things better that don't lead to violent outbursts or slow declines into violent radicalism. Healthcare, food scarcity, a better social safety net in general. We just have so many contributing issues that get us to the end point of mass shootings/gun violence.

Psychology is not an exact science. There are probably obvious cases, but essentially leaving it up to somebody’s opinion if they should have certain rights just seems like a disaster to me, and since you can’t read peoples’ minds they can just lie through it.  Red flag laws make more sense because they require action to have been taken first, but if someone is mad enough to kill their spouse I doubt they’ll willingly turn over their firearms and I’ve seen news articles were police have killed people over trying to retrieve them (which I guess is arguably a better outcome).

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted","This is a really good point. When you are rich and powerful enough, the laws plain and simply do not apply to you. A large majority of politicians on both sides are engaging in illegal activity every single day and they're getting even richer and more powerful because of it, but they have very little to fear in terms of accountability.   Nobody trusts any MAGA politicians to begin with, but the fact that even our ideological figureheads like Pelosi are free to openly violate insider trading laws for *decades* is a symptom of a much deeper issue; the complete and total lack of accountability on both sides. The fix to this is obvious, start enforcing the goddamn laws! The problem is that the people who are tasked with MAKING and enforcing the laws always do an internal investigation and discover that they were not responsible for anything.   Dave Chappelle touched on this recently. He said (in so many words) that Trump won by admitting to everyone that he and all the other politicians were cheating on their taxes. Trump admitted to it, said that makes him smart, and people will continue to cheat their taxes until the laws are enforced. The fact alone that Trump was HONEST and admitted to something that no politician would ever admit to, instantly endeared him to a lot of people. He was right about it, too! It's one of the only things he was right about in the end, but of course he was only emboldened to break more laws even harder once he got into office.  I firmly believe that as long as politicians are allowed to continue enriching themselves by breaking laws with impunity, we will not be able to process forward. With corporations making the decisions *for* politicians, at the end of the day it doesn't matter what they believe in. It only matters whether or not they have enough integrity to do the right thing when nobody is watching.",17

And both would violate bedrock separation-of-powers limitations”.  Among a million other reasons, this was the crux of Cannon's unprecedented ruling.  As a district court justice, the lowest court, she took it upon herself to intervene in a federal criminal investigation that obtained a legally-obtained search warrant and had a full filter-process for attorney client privilege or anything else the special master was supposed to accomplish.  Trump's lawyers didn't even *think* of the special master until Cannon nudged them into considering it at the 11th hour.  Making it even more humiliating - the panel was 3 Republican appointees, two by Trump.  Now Trump and his lawyers will file an emergency appeal to SCOTUS which even Trump's own largely hand-picked court will quickly swat down, and it's irrelevant in the meantime - the DOJ can continue their investigation unimpeded.

District Judge Cannon - A lower court judge appointed by Trump. Trump's lawyers used her to delay the Department of Justice investigation of Trump mishandling classified documents.

Special Master Judge Dearie - A Reagan appointed  judge from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. He also served as a judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) from 2012 to 2019. Judge Dearie is known as a very fair judge and is historically respected by both Republicans and Democrats. Trump's team and the DoJ provided Judge Cannon with a shortlist of judges to be the Special Master, however they  only agreed on Judge Dearie.^[[3]](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62893028) Judge Dearie has questioned the authority of District Court Judge Cannon and is demanding to see evidence of Trump's outlandish allegations such as the FBI  planting evidence.^[[4]](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/18/us/politics/special-master-trump-privilege.html)  4. 11^th Circuit Court of Appeals - Has jurisdiction over Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. A panel of 3 judges, including 2 Trump appointees, ruled in favour of the Justice Department and forced the lower court of Judge Cannon to reverse her decision on stopping/staying the investigation. The 11^th Circuit stayed portions of Judge Cannon's rulings, paving the way for the Justice Department to continue their investigation into Trump mishandling classified documents.^[[5]](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/appeals-court-grants-dojs-request-partial-stay-judges/story?id=90296433) Furthermore, the 11^th Circuit has just ordered the end of the Special Master review of the documents, removing a hurdle that hindered the Justice Department's criminal investigation of Trump.^[[6]](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/federal-appeals-court-halts-special-master-review-of-trumps-mar-a-lago-documents)  I recommend reading the judicial decision handed down by the Appeals Court, pay particular attention to pages 20 and 21.

za2las,Appeals court says FBI can use all documents seized in Mar-a-Lago search and ends special master review,"The executive branch oversees the Judicial branch by appointing judges. The legislative branch oversees them by holding part of the ability to amend the constitution, as well as the approval of judges. Technically also the authority to expand the court, and the impeachment process.   …However what people constantly overlook is that all this is based in good faith.  If the Supreme Court, tomorrow, handed down a 5-4 ruling that said LGBT people are not considered humans and could be enslaved/harvested/slaughtered/any other horrible thing, there is little to nothing we can directly do. Remember the famous “John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it”? That goes both ways.  If judges make blatantly illegal/unconstitutional rulings the only way to bypass them is to ignore them, which is further grounds for other judges to justify ignoring any convictions or prosecution. Imagine if Trump actually shot someone on 5th avenue and every judge dismissed the case, or if it was always appealed to the Supreme Court and they took the case and saved him regardless of justification. At that point even though you may have all the evidence and footage needed to prove beyond a doubt that he did it, you can’t actually get a “legitimate” conviction.   If any given branch acts in bad faith our system can fall apart. If one element of a branch - like a single but powerful judge - acts in bad faith, and the branches responsible for punishing them are incapable, the same end result occurs. At that point we turn to less civilized methods of opposition, or allow corruption to fester unrestricted. So far it seems we’ve mostly allowed the latter.",6

Far too much of what Trump seems to do - from my untrained eye - is simply meant for running out the clock.  And I'm not talking about just appealing every thing left and right, but [doing so literally at the very last minute *and* suddenly inventing and throwing new legal arguments in way past the initial defense argument mounted](https://www.emptywheel.net/2022/11/22/ransacked-120-minutes-before-11th-circuit-hearing-trump-attempts-to-create-a-fourth-amendment-injury/).  That last part really sticks in my mind, but I have not followed this with a legal eye - but it almost seems like he knows 10 arguments that might be worth making in a filing.  In a sane world, you or I would argue all 10 items in our defense.  But he'll argue 2 or 3, and then as he starts losing he will try to introduce new arguments later in the process - a strategy which would make sense if your goal was not to win (because you know you were not on a solid legal footing) but to delay losing as long as you possibly can.  Trump (for better or worse) IMO views the judicial process as a machine.  The more gears you can introduce into the machine, the more interfaces to target with bluster.  The MAL case is a prime example - within weeks, he had taken a rather straightforward search warrant with a single judge and spread it across four legal jurisdictions - the original FL judge who signed the search warrant, Judge Cannon, Judge Dearie in NY, and the 11th in Atlanta.  The more gears there are, the more places you can throw sand.  Sigh.    Thanks for listening to my mini-rant :)",15

Imagine Norway with 60 times the population, 30 times the area, more than 50 times the wealth. The first problem is scale. More people, land, and money equals more complexity.   Now imagine that historically a large segment of the population are bad actors, and it's so many of them for so long in parts of the country that their behavior is considered tradition and status quo there.     Now imagine a government is like an Operating System on a device. Norway's government would be more like democracy version 1.1 and stable. The US runs on version 0.8.5-Alpha with unpatched security exploits.    We might think Norway would just handle these problems in the same way if its size were increased, but some solutions don't scale and you have to account for the long history of bad actors. Now this is just a smartass Internet comment attempt to explain the problem. It's probably quite a bit more complicated.    If you look at the US by state you'll even see varying degrees of successful governance there.

So officials are willing to debase and weaken the branches they serve in service of their party. You get Judges like Cannon blatantly using the courts to aid her party benefactor and a Congress unwilling to hold their party's President to account for abuse of power and misconduct(of course this applies to one party more than the other, but the structural incentives still apply to both). You also get a Congress, which was by some measures intended to be the dominant branch, that is willing to kneecap itself through internal procedure and defer its powers to the Executive.

yy1m2p,GOP operative found guilty of funneling Russian money to Donald Trump,"A Republican political strategist was convicted of illegally helping a Russian businessman contribute to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016.  Jesse Benton, 44, was pardoned by Trump in 2020 for a different campaign finance crime, months before he was indicted again on six counts related to facilitating an illegal foreign campaign donation. He was found guilty Thursday on all six counts.  Elections “reflect the values and the priorities and the beliefs of American citizens,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Parikh said in her closing argument this week. “Jesse Benton by his actions did damage to those principles.”  The evidence at trial showed that Benton bought a $25,000 ticket to a September 2016 Republican National Committee (RNC) event on behalf of Roman Vasilenko, a Russian naval officer turned multilevel marketer. (Vasilenko is under investigation in Russia for allegedly running a pyramid scheme, according to the Kommersant newspaper; he could not be reached for comment.) The donation got Vasilenko a picture with Trump and entrance to a “business roundtable” with the future president.  Vasilenko connected with Benton through Doug Wead, an evangelical ally of the Bush family who was also involved in multilevel marketing. Vasilenko sent $100,000 to Benton, who was working for a pro-Trump super PAC at the time, supposedly for consulting services. Benton subsequently donated $25,000 to the RNC by credit card to cover the ticket.  Witnesses from the RNC and the firm hired to organize the event said they weren’t told Vasilenko was a Russian citizen. Benton said in an email to his RNC contact that Vasilenko was “a friend who spends most of his time in the Caribbean”; he described Vasilenko’s interpreter as “a body gal.” In fact, according to the testimony, Benton and Vasilenko had never met.  Benton argued that he followed the advice of his previous counsel, David A. Warrington, who has also represented Trump. Warrington testified that Benton contacted him at the time to ask if he could give a ticket to a political fundraiser to a Russian citizen. Warrington said he told Benton “there is no prohibition on a Russian citizen receiving a ticket to an event” and that “you can give your ticket that you purchased to a fundraiser to anybody.”  Prosecutors said Benton failed to tell Warrington that he was getting reimbursed by the Russian citizen for the donation. Benton asked for the advice only “to cover his tracks,” Parikh said.  Benton also claimed that he earned the $100,000 acting as a tour guide in Washington for Vasilenko, whose interest was not politics but self-promotion.  Wead — who died at age 75 last December after he was indicted with Benton — had previously discussed with Vasilenko the possibility of a photograph with Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama or Steven Seagal before suggesting Trump.  “If Oprah was available,” defense attorney Brian Stolarz said in his closing argument, “we wouldn’t even be here.”  Vasilenko posted the photograph of himself with Trump on Instagram with a banner that said “Two Presidents” and advertised his own company. He said Benton “delivered on what he was asked to do,” which was “get him in a picture with a celebrity” so Vasilenko “could brag on Instagram.” To Vasilenko, he said, Trump was not a politician but “the guy who used to be on ‘The Apprentice.’ ” At the roundtable, he said Trump appeared only briefly and “just talked about polls.”  Stolarz emphasized that there was no evidence Vasilenko ever engaged with Trump outside the single event, and no evidence the RNC ever returned the donation. Witnesses from the RNC said they were in the dark about the origin of the funds.  “He wants to be an influencer,” Stolarz said. “This is just shameless self-promotion from a guy who can afford to take this picture.”  But prosecutors said that once it was offered, Vasilenko saw the value of an introduction to Trump. He was running for parliament in Russia at the time, according to the Justice Department, and after Trump’s election was invited on Russian television.  “He’s sophisticated,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Wasserman told jurors. “He got access to someone he helped elect.”  Benton’s defense downplayed the $25,000 as “nothing” in an election that cost billions.  “This is not some nefarious backroom scheme to funnel millions of dollars from Russia,” he said.  Prosecutors argued that every dollar counted in a race where Democrat Hillary Clinton was far ahead in fundraising, and that Benton knew Trump needed money at the time.  Stolarz said Benton was also paid to organize a charity dinner Vasilenko attended on his U.S. trip, which prosecutors dismissed as a cheap meal at a chain restaurant.  “They may try to downplay it, but Maggiano’s is good,” Stolarz said.  Benton began his career on the GOP’s libertarian fringe as an aide to former congressman Ron Paul (R-Tex.), whose granddaughter is Benton’s wife. He gained mainstream credibility helping Paul’s son, Rand Paul (R-Ky.), win a Senate seat in 2010 and was hired by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) 2014 reelection campaign.  But Benton resigned before that election amid an investigation into whether an Iowa state senator was bribed to support Ron Paul in the 2012 presidential race. Benton was convicted in May 2016 of conspiracy and involvement in filing of false campaign finance reports — not long before the new scheme began.  “He knew the law,” Wasserman said. “He knew the rules.”  After the verdict, Stolarz said Benton “maintains his innocence and plans to appeal.”  Robyn Dixon contributed to this report.",6

yy1m2p,GOP operative found guilty of funneling Russian money to Donald Trump,"The real story has barely been written about or investigated. It was made pretty clear that the NRA was compromised by a female Russian agent. She was part of millions being funneled through the NRA to GOP campaigns. She's disappeared and around the time her involvement with the NRA was being made public was when Trump's Treasury Dept under Mnuchin moved to block the release of dark money donors names that were associated with the NRA. It's not some wild conspiracy theory. It's long been questioned how the NRA raised so much money when its membership totals were not enough to match its donations to GOP campaign funds. NRA membership is made of mostly average people so the MILLIONS it raised exceeded what it's membership really would have been able to raise. The math didn't add up and then this woman, Maria Butina, is linked to the NRA and the Kremlin, then Trump administration blocks access to NRA donor list. Yes she spent time in prison but it all ends there as she went back to Russia. Then it all just ends. That was also around the time NY AG began dismantling the NRA and stories of top NRA people living big money lifestyles. Puzzle isn't hard to figure out and Trump/Putin right in the middle. NRA/Kremlin predates Trump but how long not sure. Trump's presidency made many panic in the GOP and that led to their dark money donor list being blocked. It's no conspiracy. Just rich and powerful doing whatever tf they want without consequences. If this ever truly brought into the light it would show not only Trump but numerous GOP members were involved with Russia. Did they know NRA funds were coming from Russia? Will likely never find out or decades down the road. It's simple to connect the dots but without the evidence to truly prove how one party was compromised by a foreign country it may never be known.",5

So, this guy can see well enough to repair delicate electronics, but his vision was just bad that day, I guess. Conveniently, he apparently didn't have security cameras either.  One thing that people should acknowledge is that the files were legit. The FBI did confirm that. It seems Hunter Biden used nepotism to stumble into these jobs and it seemed like he tried to use his father's name to secure deals. The issue is that there is no proof that Joe Biden was in on it, or that Hunter's strategy worked at all.  The real question is where did these files come from? That's what we should all be focusing on. The laptop repair guy is clearly a GOP operative, and the fall guy here. I'm willing to bet that these Hunter Biden files were obtained through absolutely sketchy means. I think Russia (or some other foreign entity) gave these files to members of the GOP.  Think about it, you now have dirt on a political opponent, obtained illegally through foreign collision, and you have to get them out somehow. You decide to put these files on a laptop, and claim that Hunter Biden personally dropped off the laptop. Of course, we can't prove that it was actually Hunter's laptop, or that he bought it. The entire thing fucking reeks of some dirty GOP/Russian collusion. I think that this aspect is much bigger than the files themselves, which do not actually implicate Joe Biden in any sort of crimes.   I just find it EXTREMELY hard to believe that Hunter dropped off some laptop, with all this dirt on him (including archived text messages), to a guy who just happened to be a GOP operative, then ""forgot"" to pick the laptop back up.

At a time when then candidate Trump had been warned by the FBI that Russians and other foreign adversaries would try to interfere with the election and was asked to alert the FBI of any suspicious overtures to their campaign.^[[1]](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-warned-trump-2016-russians-would-try-infiltrate-his-campaign-n830596) Despite the intelligence briefing then candidate Trump continued to deny any wrong-doing by the Russians during the campaign.^[[2]](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-again-says-u-s-doesn-t-know-if-russia-n670186)  Roger Stone was directed by the Trump Campaign to find out about potential future releases;^[[3]](https://www.scribd.com/document/398210081/Stone-Indictment-012419#from_embed)  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. ROGER JASON STONE, JR.  >4. ROGER JASON STONE, JR. was a political consultant who worked for decades in U.S.  politics and on U.S. political campaigns. STONE was an official on the U.S. presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump (“Trump Campaign”) until in or around August 2015, and maintained regular contact with and publicly supported the Trump Campaign through the 2016 election. 5.   >5. During the summer of 2016, STONE spoke to senior Trump Campaign officials about Organization 1 and information it might have had that would be damaging to the Clinton Campaign. STONE was contacted by senior Trump Campaign officials to inquire about future releases by Organization 1.  >11. By in or around June and July 2016, STONE informed senior Trump Campaign officials that he had information indicating Organization 1 had documents whose release would be damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The head of Organization 1 was located at all relevant times at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, United Kingdom.  >12. After the July 22, 2016 release of stolen DNC emails by Organization 1, a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact STONE about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton Campaign. STONE thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by Organization 1.  >17. On or about October 7, 2016, Organization 1 released the first set of emails stolen from the Clinton Campaign chairman. Shortly after Organization 1’s release, an associate of the high-ranking Trump Campaign official sent a text message to STONE that read “well done.” In subsequent conversations with senior Trump Campaign officials, STONE claimed credit for having correctly predicted the October 7, 2016 release.  Furthermore, over the course of the Special Counsel's investigation into Russian election hacking the government obtained and executed dozens of search warrants. Several of those search warrants were executed on accounts that contained Stone’s direct communications with Wikileaks and Guccifer 2.0 (Russian intelligence officers);^[[4]](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5740797/2-15-19-US-Stone-Related-Case.pdf)  >Certain Netyksho defendants, through a fictitious online persona they created, Guccifer 2.0, also interacted directly with Stone concerning other stolen materials posted separately online.   >...As alleged in the Netyksho indictment, in 2016, the Netyksho defendants stole documents from the DNC, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Clinton campaign chairman. Those defendants then released many of the stolen documents, including through a website maintained by Organization 1. In the course of investigating that activity, the government obtained and executed dozens of search warrants on various accounts used to facilitate the transfer of stolen documents for release, as well as to discuss the timing and promotion of their release. Several of those search warrants were executed on accounts that contained Stone’s communications with Guccifer 2.0 and with Organization 1. Evidence obtained from those search warrants resulted in the allegations that the Netyksho defendants hacked and stole documents for release through intermediaries, including Organization 1, and that Stone lied to a congressional committee investigating, among other things, the activities of Organization 1 regarding those stolen documents. The relevant search warrants, which are being produced to the defendant in discovery in this case, are discussed further in a sealed addendum to this filing.   Moreover, former Trump Campaign adviser Roger Stone was charged on 7 counts including 5 counts for providing false statements meant to mislead Congressional investigators about his communications with Wikileaks;^[[5]](https://www.scribd.com/document/398210081/Stone-Indictment-012419#from_embed)   >COUNTS TWO THROUGH SIX (False Statements)  >43.

yy1m2p,GOP operative found guilty of funneling Russian money to Donald Trump,"I don't think it was ever Hunter Biden's laptop, I don't believe for one minute that even a fueled-by-crack Hunter Biden would create the incriminating videos that we know to exist, store them on the laptop (a laptop with a Beau Biden Foundation sticker affixed), take the laptop to a computer repair shop where ironically a GOP operative worked, mind you a GOP operative who claimed he couldn't visually confirm that it was Hunter himself who dropped of the water damaged laptop because ""his eyesight is bad"", but he was ""pretty sure it was him due to the smell of alcohol"", and Hunter not only never returned to pickup this laptop, but couldn't be reached by phone? We're supposed to believe that a laptop repair tech with eyes so bad that he couldn't confirm the visual identity of a man, but could work on electronics with extremely tiny components and screws? This repair technician also happens to be a GOP operative who knew who Hunter Biden is, but couldn't identify him? He then allegedly contacts the FBI, who order him to hand over the laptop, but not before he secretly clones the hard drive to an external drive, who he gives to Giuliani's lawyer and they share it with the post?  Here's what I think...   1. I don't think Hunter Biden dropped off a water damaged MacBook to a computer repair shop that was also coincidentally run by a GOP operative who was clued in on why the GOP might want dirt on Hunter Biden. I believe that either the Russians managed to hack or otherwise gain access to Hunters email/cloud storage, or got access hacking his laptop or phone, which could have also had both the video shown and emails as most people sync their email to their laptops and phones. I think the Russians managed to get this data and the laptop story is a cover to hide how the information was obtained. It's also feasible that the laptop was stolen from Hunter, hacked, then dropped off at the GOP operative repair shop, who's eyesight was too poor to confirm that it was actually Hunter. Maybe the woman in the video (or another that Hunter partied with) was an operative and stole / cloned the laptop. There is no fucking way I'll be believe that Hunter willingly dropped off his personal laptop at a random computer repair shop, knowing what was on it, crack smoking or not, and then never attempted to get it back, absolutely zero fucking chance. Hunter may have had a substance abuse issue, but he's also quite intelligent and well educated being a Yale law graduate, he also has spent considerable time in finance.   2. I think Hunter did what most other connected Yale grads do, he used his name and sold the idea of access or potential influence in return for business deals / lucrative arrangements, otherwise known as lobbying. Politically connected and extremely wealthy people do this shit all the time, it's almost exclusively how they operate. The saying ""its who you know"" means everything, there are people out there worth billions who have done little more than connect and vouch for people, provide access to important people, get an otherwise unlikely meeting, and peddle influence, I mean that's sort if politics in a nutshell, and is much of what lobbying really is, what is what Hunter has always been, a lobbyist. I think Hunter was just like all the other connected lobbyists, doing the same shit so they don't actually have to work for a living.  I would still argue that all of the questionable lobbying and high-level influence / access issues that Hunter either has done or has been alleged to have done, pales in comparison to what we 100% know Jared and Ivanka did to enrich themselves during Trump's time in office. I don't have proof of Hunter being buddies with MBS, or otherwise arranging lucrative deals with the Saudi's, but somehow if Hunter used his name and clout to milk money out of a Chinese firm connected to the CCP, (news flash, basically every company in China is connected to the CCP) that's somehow worse?",245
yy1m2p,GOP operative found guilty of funneling Russian money to Donald Trump,The real issue everyone is ignoring is WTF does Hunter Biden have to do with ANYTHING?? HE'S NOT THE PRESIDENT.  And I'd be willing to bet Joe doesn't control what his son does either way. It's freakin' IRRELEVANT.,10
yy1m2p,GOP operative found guilty of funneling Russian money to Donald Trump,"It's not hypocrisy for the people that are making the decisions, they know it's bullshit. They just also know that it will reduce similar action from their opponents to appear like petty political cheap shots.   For instance, Trump got impeached twice for very legitimate, serious reasons, and both the Mueller report and the Jan 6 committee have presented very solid cases for more serious crimes.  If the Republicans make a showing of attempting to impeach Biden (and/or his cabinet) and start fruitless commitees and investigations into their opponents, it will downplay the legitimate ones, at least in the eyes of certain people who lack any critical thinking skills.  They want to make it look like accusations of criminal activity are just another political tool and should be forgotten as mud slinging.",7

yy1m2p,GOP operative found guilty of funneling Russian money to Donald Trump,"Worked in PC repair. Standard operating procedure requires the clients ID be photocopied and his signature taken when dropping off ANYTHING for repair. This is to protect our own asses as well as the customers property if it somehow ends up MIA. A receipt is given for the drop off as well as a copy of all the signed materials.  The customer gets a call after the free inspection (or not free depending on the store) and we tell them what is wrong, what it costs to get it fixed and if we should move forward or do they want to pick it up and go elsewhere. This call is typically recorded as evidence to move forward with the repair(on top of the signed documents).  We fix said item and call the customer for pickup(this is when they usually pay for the repairs). However, if after say 3-6 months(of constantly calling and emailing customer to pick it up) the property is considered abandoned. It is cleaned up, wiped and set for sale online or in store.  So far said ""shop"" has not done any of this which makes me feel as if the entire thing was smoke and mirrors or as you said above, a setup. Everything about it reeks of improper handling of property, if Hunter really was present there most certainly WOULD be a photocopied ID with all the info as well as his signature, often in triplicate.",5

Dismissing the entire story as fake is counterproductive, because there is this real, legitimate question regarding how all of these files were obtained. I think that these files were obtained through extremely sketchy/illegal means, and the entire laptop story is a total fabrication. I find that part to be a much more compelling story.

This was a legitimate endeavor permitted by the South Korean government.  In 1999, Daewoo went bankrupt, splitting into a number of subsidiary corporations. In 2011, the Trump Organization took a $20 million loan from one of these corporations, which has no ties to North Korea other than sharing a name and some assets with a company that did. Unless Trump personally guaranteed this loan, which there is no evidence to suggest, there was no legal requirement for him to report this.   In 2017, 20 years after a company that briefly operated a factory in North Korea went bankrupt, the Trump Organization paid off a loan to one of its subsidiaries. There’s no evidence of any malfeasance here. You could say just as easily that Ford is a company with Nazi ties.",4

Buy a company, accrue debut, have the company buy your debt from other successful companies, cut the company in half with anything valuable getting packaged into a sales package you sell to yourself for pennies on the dollar, and sell off the toxic collection of debt under a recognizable name to some chump or fall-guy who will do their best to ask the government for help socializing the losses as much as possible.  Oh, and in most cases, the workers are lumped in with the toxic collection. As are loans taken out against their pensions. Though the money from the loans tends to mysteriously ""disappear"" into funds that get packaged with the sales package that the vultures pick up.  When Republican'ts say ""run it like a business"", they mean ""into the ground"" because modern conservatism is nothing more than a post WW1 movement that seeks to re-install a class of nobility over a class of serfs, and this movement has managed to somehow convince a bunch of serfs that they will be the nobility. Which is why they look forward to things like the collapse of the government and the fall of democracy.  Conservatism is aimed at people who are too stupid to make decisions for themselves, know it, and hate responsibility so much they would rather bend over and take it raw from someone able to sell them an idea as long as it's packaged with a feeling of superiority over someone else.

Left-leaning Americans need to party after election wins, like we saw in Brazil.  Ok, so maybe Joe Biden isn't your cup of tea. Maybe Democrats aren't quite as left-wing or right-wing as you'd like. But you know who's worse? The nutjobs on the far right, who have no ideas and are basically in a Christian-themed personality cult that worships their Dear Leader, who's a complete moron (at best). Oh, and these guys also believe any election they lose is ""rigged.""  I think a lot of people were worried about Brazil's election, and whether Bolsonaro would concede, or the military would step in. But so far, things seem to be going well. And I think it's because when Lula won, people went out an celebrated.  https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/oct/31/lula-da-silva-brazilians-celebrate-leftist-leaders-narrow-victory-video  It's a lot harder to overturn an election when you see how many people you're really up against. And it's also way harder to whine about election fraud when those people that voted get out and march (just think of how many people justify their election fraud BS with the fact that Trump had way bigger cult rallies during the pandemic).  So, with Arizona finally called and Nevada looking like it's probably going to go Dem, if just barely (and there's sure to be plenty of whining), I think it'd be great for thousands of Americans to take to the streets to celebrate these victories. Don't like Biden? Bring a sign that says ""Biden sucks, but he's way better than these clowns"" or something more catchy than that. I'll leave the specifics to you, but I think this show of enthusiasm might help people realize that their far right bullshit is way less popular than they think it is.

Area 51 has a bunch of cool stuff in it, including the extremely popular Omega Mart. Fremont Street has basically all the tourist stuff jammed into it if you wanna knock out a bunch of that. There's tons of themed bars and restaurants, just look for something in your genre of entertainment(Cats Cafe on Fremont is like pastel karaoke, Nightmare Cafe is horror themed, Player 1 is video games and my favorite). There's dispensaries everywhere if you want weed. Lots of hiking trails and beautiful scenery(the Alltrails app is helpful). The Hoover Dam is cool to see but the water level is scary and sad. I wouldn't recommend visiting Lake Mead. Something about a puddle of corpse water is just nasty. Plenty of casinos of course, I prefer the Station chain. Freezing and Phoenix and fun gay bars, but none of the gay bars I've been to here are super exciting.   I would /really/ not recommend living here.

If people can't shitpost, they will 100% leave. If there's no audience, famous people and influencers will leave too.  All the conservative versions of Twitter have terrible maintenance. It's going to be like that. Unfortunately, most of the shitposters will come here.",7

I was living in NYC at the time. There’s so much revolting DT gangrenous shit that preceded his presidency that basically no one not from ny knows about.   Democrat? come on - i’d identify this cumrag creature a shapeshifter but for my respect for shapeshifters.   to croc’s point: this shitbag, himself by then a highly skilled rapist, called for their summary executions and doubled down when they were exonerated a dozen years later. they weren’t choir boys (the smart play w what we know now), but they had nothing to do with this victim’s horrible assault (she was violently beaten and raped while on an evening run in a “safe” part of CP). NOTHING.   this orange motherfucker is a dangerous tumor, people. and while but a useful conduit for the amplified transmission of the violently negative hatred of an astonishing number of americans and other simple-minded whites, the head of the snake usually does the trick.    so i say starve cheeto raper of the principal portal for his violent, insurrectionist messaging, now and forever.",16
