yqa3cg,"John Fetterman wins Pennsylvania Senate race, defeating TV doctor Mehmet Oz and flipping key state for Democrats","Do not let this momentum down. Do not let the next two years or any comfort returning to our systems allow you to forget or grow complacent. Keep up with knowing and contacting your current leaders as well as any prospectives for the next election. It is the people who must protect democracy and freedom above all, even if our institutions fail. The Supreme Court is still stacked illegitimately.   We must remain vigilant. We must not forget that politics cannot be turned off for so many that the democrats are allies towards (due to race, sexuality, relationships, gender, identity, and so much more). We must not forget that the past eight years since Trump picked up his vulgar campaigns has exposed the rot in our country and the outright danger these groups that cannot turn off politics are in from their own neighbors. KKK resurgences in rural communities, nazi proud boy torch marches, protestors being plowed through where a woman was killed, violences against people specifically targetted for their race, immigration status, sexuality, or religion. And of course January 6th.  We must never forget if we want our country to withstand the next two decades, let alone trying to envision it in the next century.",35,0

Since 2020 millennials are now the largest working age cohort. Across the economy I think we’ve seen many a boomer retire over the last 10 years. That’s closing out this decade. Actual attrition (deaths) varies of course based on health. Many retirees are reliable at the polls and they skew to one particular party.

An even larger number of silent gen and boomers will be dead. All of gen z will be able to vote by 2030.   Not too too long from now.

Gen z is also kinda the tech gen. I was born in 04 I'm barely younger than the iphone. Kids born in 08 have been surrounded by computers in pockets all their life. Which exposures them to different view points and educational resources to say the least. Which can help them become very progressive  Someone born in the 1980s probably never had a friend who's gay or trans or had one maybe two. Kids nowadays can easily be friends with a gay Iraqi or a Trans Siberian a lesbian from England, a bi sexual from Taiwan , a non binary pal for Brazil.  Which gives them a better perspective of people and what life's can look like.   I'm not explaining my point correctly but still   That's why schools are a battle ground for Republicans. Lots of gen Z is still in school they desperately want gen Z to be non progressive. Desantis is 44 he'll be alive and well in 20 years. He could live and be active in politics even when he's old as trump. (76 so around 32 years from now) kids not even born yet will be old enough to vote against him by then.

The core issue was that this message of the Abrams' campaign was not really viable after Kemp rejected Trump. Georgia independent voters hence thought that Kemp was legit. Abrams' campaign could no longer square this argument, yet they kept pushing it.   Abrams' campaign just sort of floundered, while Warnock continued to outperform Walker even though Abrams and Warnock were mostly on the same campaigning page because they were both state-wide elections.  edit: ffs people, I was saying Abrams was facing the same prejudice minority women running for office everywhere face and adding what truly ruined her campaign outside of that swing.

His legendary line about Clinton, ""Hillary, your lips are moving and you're lying"" still tickles me.  I think we need more people willing to call politicians out and make them uncomfortable.  edit2: The video you linked reminded me that Gravel was actually a pioneer of using social media (I guess youtube at the time wasn't considered social media) and other budding internet services to supplement his campaign.

Churches are tax exempt because many churches and other religious organizations are considered ""charities"" under IRS Code Section 501(c)(3).  *Any* charity (as designated by Section 501(c)(3)) is tax exempt. This is **not** just for churches.  https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/churches-integrated-auxiliaries-and-conventions-or-associations-of-churches  https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/are-churches-always-exempt.html  Also consider that many churches and other religious organizations perform charity work, including food banks, job training, clothing distribution, homeless shelters, legal aid, and other ""social"" programs to help underprivileged individuals and families. Providing these types of services *in general* **should** be tax exempt if they're not running for-profit since they produce a net-benefit for society.  A lot of us might dislike the idea that they also use such social programs to ""spread the word"" so to say, but honestly that's just a good marketing strategy on their part. You also have to understand that many of these organizations strongly believe a lot of social issues would be ""cured"" if people just followed whatever flavor of religion they're preaching. I'm not saying I agree or disagree with that perspective; Instead I'm saying that's simply what a lot of the people running them believe based on numerous conversations and reading discussions with religious people on this very topic.  Right, wrong, or indifferent, they *are* still contributing social benefits to many people and communities in one way or another.

yhbmls,"Churches Are Breaking the Law by Endorsing in Elections, Experts Say.

Catholicism, in my experience, is all about reverence and communion, the sermon is usually light and it’s more about quietly respecting the rituals.  In my childhood we went to a Methodist church for a while. It felt like it was a lot more about community. Also the sermons built on each other so it was like a television show with seasons (lead up to Easter/Christmas/etc).  My parents current church is evangelical, a lot of people from the Methodist church moved away so they started going where my grandparents and aunts went.  There is a sense of community involved and they like it because of the music and how friendly everyone is. The problem is the sermons. I came home a few times for Christmas and went to Christmas Eve service. I thought it was funny that on Christmas Eve, there was no mention of Christ’s birth or the gifts of the wisemen or anything. The sermon (I used to joke until I noticed a trend and it felt sinister) was basically “haters gonna hate but you just keep being you.” This was funny to me until I saw an Easter service there, again, “haters gonna hate but you just keep being you” (obviously not worded like that), no death or resurrection of Christ or saving the world of sins. That was when I realized the dark truth. Evangelical churches (at least the one my family goes to) don’t teach the stories or messages of Christianity. They celebrate the divinity of Jesus, talk about how people need to be saved and go to heaven, and preach a perceived persecution which they solely justify with Christianity’s absence in pop culture.  So let’s first not confuse all of Christianity for Evangelicals, but given the power of the Evangelical branch, the alarm should be raised. They don’t listen to what Jesus said, it is outrage porn with light music and smiles on top of it.",4,0

Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.”  This is 100% directed at Christians. Explaining to them that many Christians will never follow the correct path. And very few will actually find the correct one because many will never truly even look for the correct path and will blindly follow what they’ve been taught vs. trying to figure it out on their own. But it gets twisted out of context to justify the ignorance of their actions.  It goes on to say “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.

If of sound mind and no previous criminal history I should be able to own firearms. I should be able to own firearms that aren't limited to arbitrary capacity limits. I should be able to own firearms with all the tacticool attachments if I decide to for out the money for them. Fully automatic weapons? I am totally fine with not having access to them. Being stuck with a handgun that has a fewer than 10 rd capacity? That annoys me to no end.      I fully support more intensive background checks. I support a licensing registry. Psychological evals being a requirement for purchase and ownership although the ins and outs of that are more iffy than the others. ""Red Flag"" laws in the right capacity and use could save lives. Charges with a violent offense, especially a domestic? We are gonna hold onto your firearms until your case is over. Hell I would go so far as to even say if you have a divorce proceeding ongoing you should be mandated to go through a full evaluation to see if you should be able to keep your weapons. Do some of these seem draconian to hard 2nd amendment backers? Sure they do. Will they work? Absolutely.

GOP won't increase funding for mental health and the dems are just trying to attack a feels argument. Personal defense wise firearms are great to have. I have a right as a human being to be able to defend myself. Whether physical disabilities cause someone not to be able to physically fight or in the case of women at times the sheer gap in physicality that exists between them and men, some people need an equalizer.      The thing the Dems/Left have over the GOP mainly is they want to make things better that don't lead to violent outbursts or slow declines into violent radicalism. Healthcare, food scarcity, a better social safety net in general. We just have so many contributing issues that get us to the end point of mass shootings/gun violence.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted","This is a really good point. When you are rich and powerful enough, the laws plain and simply do not apply to you. A large majority of politicians on both sides are engaging in illegal activity every single day and they're getting even richer and more powerful because of it, but they have very little to fear in terms of accountability.   Nobody trusts any MAGA politicians to begin with, but the fact that even our ideological figureheads like Pelosi are free to openly violate insider trading laws for *decades* is a symptom of a much deeper issue; the complete and total lack of accountability on both sides. The fix to this is obvious, start enforcing the goddamn laws! The problem is that the people who are tasked with MAKING and enforcing the laws always do an internal investigation and discover that they were not responsible for anything.   Dave Chappelle touched on this recently. He said (in so many words) that Trump won by admitting to everyone that he and all the other politicians were cheating on their taxes. Trump admitted to it, said that makes him smart, and people will continue to cheat their taxes until the laws are enforced. The fact alone that Trump was HONEST and admitted to something that no politician would ever admit to, instantly endeared him to a lot of people. He was right about it, too! It's one of the only things he was right about in the end, but of course he was only emboldened to break more laws even harder once he got into office.  I firmly believe that as long as politicians are allowed to continue enriching themselves by breaking laws with impunity, we will not be able to process forward. With corporations making the decisions *for* politicians, at the end of the day it doesn't matter what they believe in. It only matters whether or not they have enough integrity to do the right thing when nobody is watching.",15,0

yy1m2p,GOP operative found guilty of funneling Russian money to Donald Trump,"A Republican political strategist was convicted of illegally helping a Russian businessman contribute to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016.  Jesse Benton, 44, was pardoned by Trump in 2020 for a different campaign finance crime, months before he was indicted again on six counts related to facilitating an illegal foreign campaign donation. He was found guilty Thursday on all six counts.  Elections “reflect the values and the priorities and the beliefs of American citizens,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Parikh said in her closing argument this week. “Jesse Benton by his actions did damage to those principles.”  The evidence at trial showed that Benton bought a $25,000 ticket to a September 2016 Republican National Committee (RNC) event on behalf of Roman Vasilenko, a Russian naval officer turned multilevel marketer. (Vasilenko is under investigation in Russia for allegedly running a pyramid scheme, according to the Kommersant newspaper; he could not be reached for comment.) The donation got Vasilenko a picture with Trump and entrance to a “business roundtable” with the future president.  Vasilenko connected with Benton through Doug Wead, an evangelical ally of the Bush family who was also involved in multilevel marketing. Vasilenko sent $100,000 to Benton, who was working for a pro-Trump super PAC at the time, supposedly for consulting services. Benton subsequently donated $25,000 to the RNC by credit card to cover the ticket.  Witnesses from the RNC and the firm hired to organize the event said they weren’t told Vasilenko was a Russian citizen. Benton said in an email to his RNC contact that Vasilenko was “a friend who spends most of his time in the Caribbean”; he described Vasilenko’s interpreter as “a body gal.” In fact, according to the testimony, Benton and Vasilenko had never met.  Benton argued that he followed the advice of his previous counsel, David A. Warrington, who has also represented Trump. Warrington testified that Benton contacted him at the time to ask if he could give a ticket to a political fundraiser to a Russian citizen. Warrington said he told Benton “there is no prohibition on a Russian citizen receiving a ticket to an event” and that “you can give your ticket that you purchased to a fundraiser to anybody.”  Prosecutors said Benton failed to tell Warrington that he was getting reimbursed by the Russian citizen for the donation. Benton asked for the advice only “to cover his tracks,” Parikh said.  Benton also claimed that he earned the $100,000 acting as a tour guide in Washington for Vasilenko, whose interest was not politics but self-promotion.  Wead — who died at age 75 last December after he was indicted with Benton — had previously discussed with Vasilenko the possibility of a photograph with Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama or Steven Seagal before suggesting Trump.  “If Oprah was available,” defense attorney Brian Stolarz said in his closing argument, “we wouldn’t even be here.”  Vasilenko posted the photograph of himself with Trump on Instagram with a banner that said “Two Presidents” and advertised his own company. He said Benton “delivered on what he was asked to do,” which was “get him in a picture with a celebrity” so Vasilenko “could brag on Instagram.” To Vasilenko, he said, Trump was not a politician but “the guy who used to be on ‘The Apprentice.’ ” At the roundtable, he said Trump appeared only briefly and “just talked about polls.”  Stolarz emphasized that there was no evidence Vasilenko ever engaged with Trump outside the single event, and no evidence the RNC ever returned the donation. Witnesses from the RNC said they were in the dark about the origin of the funds.  “He wants to be an influencer,” Stolarz said. “This is just shameless self-promotion from a guy who can afford to take this picture.”  But prosecutors said that once it was offered, Vasilenko saw the value of an introduction to Trump. He was running for parliament in Russia at the time, according to the Justice Department, and after Trump’s election was invited on Russian television.  “He’s sophisticated,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Wasserman told jurors. “He got access to someone he helped elect.”  Benton’s defense downplayed the $25,000 as “nothing” in an election that cost billions.  “This is not some nefarious backroom scheme to funnel millions of dollars from Russia,” he said.  Prosecutors argued that every dollar counted in a race where Democrat Hillary Clinton was far ahead in fundraising, and that Benton knew Trump needed money at the time.  Stolarz said Benton was also paid to organize a charity dinner Vasilenko attended on his U.S. trip, which prosecutors dismissed as a cheap meal at a chain restaurant.  “They may try to downplay it, but Maggiano’s is good,” Stolarz said.  Benton began his career on the GOP’s libertarian fringe as an aide to former congressman Ron Paul (R-Tex.), whose granddaughter is Benton’s wife. He gained mainstream credibility helping Paul’s son, Rand Paul (R-Ky.), win a Senate seat in 2010 and was hired by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) 2014 reelection campaign.  But Benton resigned before that election amid an investigation into whether an Iowa state senator was bribed to support Ron Paul in the 2012 presidential race. Benton was convicted in May 2016 of conspiracy and involvement in filing of false campaign finance reports — not long before the new scheme began.  “He knew the law,” Wasserman said. “He knew the rules.”  After the verdict, Stolarz said Benton “maintains his innocence and plans to appeal.”  Robyn Dixon contributed to this report.",6,0

yy1m2p,GOP operative found guilty of funneling Russian money to Donald Trump,"The real story has barely been written about or investigated. It was made pretty clear that the NRA was compromised by a female Russian agent. She was part of millions being funneled through the NRA to GOP campaigns. She's disappeared and around the time her involvement with the NRA was being made public was when Trump's Treasury Dept under Mnuchin moved to block the release of dark money donors names that were associated with the NRA. It's not some wild conspiracy theory. It's long been questioned how the NRA raised so much money when its membership totals were not enough to match its donations to GOP campaign funds. NRA membership is made of mostly average people so the MILLIONS it raised exceeded what it's membership really would have been able to raise. The math didn't add up and then this woman, Maria Butina, is linked to the NRA and the Kremlin, then Trump administration blocks access to NRA donor list. Yes she spent time in prison but it all ends there as she went back to Russia. Then it all just ends. That was also around the time NY AG began dismantling the NRA and stories of top NRA people living big money lifestyles. Puzzle isn't hard to figure out and Trump/Putin right in the middle. NRA/Kremlin predates Trump but how long not sure. Trump's presidency made many panic in the GOP and that led to their dark money donor list being blocked. It's no conspiracy. Just rich and powerful doing whatever tf they want without consequences. If this ever truly brought into the light it would show not only Trump but numerous GOP members were involved with Russia. Did they know NRA funds were coming from Russia? Will likely never find out or decades down the road.

yy1m2p,GOP operative found guilty of funneling Russian money to Donald Trump,"Fantastic sourcing, thank you for providing primary sources. The bi-partisan Senate investigation reports show a sophisticated operation of foreign influence.   I wanted to add a little more context with regard to your final point about Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, a convicted felon who was pardoned by then President Trump. Earlier this year Manafort admitted to sharing internal polling data with a Russian spy during an interview. Trump removed sanctions for a Russian oligarch that Manafort owed money to.   - Trump Campaign Chairman and convicted felon Paul Manafort^[[1]](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/paul-manafort-sentenced-on-foreign-lobbying-and-witness-tampering-charges) was closely associated with Russian Oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Deripaska gave Manafort a $10 million loan several years ago.^[[2]](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-manafort/manafort-had-10-million-loan-from-russian-oligarch-court-filing-idUSKBN1JN2YF) Konstantin Kilimnik was reportedly the liaison between Manafort and Deripaska when Manafort worked in Ukraine.   - Kilimnik met with Trump Campaign Chairman Manafort and Deputy Campaign Chairman Gates on August 2^nd 2016 where Manafort shared internal polling data with the Russian operative. In August, 2022 Manafort confirmed that he shared internal polling data with the Russians.^[[3]](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/paul-manafort-gave-trump-campaign-data-russians)  - A judge ruled that Paul Manafort had broken his plea agreement, he lied to investigators about his contact with Konstantin Kilimnik.^[[4]](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-rules-manafort-intentionally-lied-to-mueller-team-voiding-plea-agreement)    - The Trump administration removed sanctions from Oleg Deripaska's companies including Rusal.^[[5]](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/us/politics/oleg-deripaska-russian-sanctions.html)  What's fascinating is that the Trump administration removed sanctions from Oleg Deripaska's companies. The Mueller report found that Paul Manafort was pursuing his personal interests by attempting to use his position in the campaign to settle previous debts he had incurred with Oleg Deripaska. The Mueller report confirmed that Trump campaign chairman and deputy chairman Manafort and Gates were sharing sensitive, internal polling data with Kilimnik. The report went on to mention that Deputy Campaign Chairman Rick Gates thought Kilimnik was a spy.   Per Pages 130 - 137 of the report;^[[6]](https://media.npr.org/assets/news/2019/04/muellerreport.pdf)   >The Office could not reliably determine Manafort's purpose in sharing internal polling data with Kilimnik during the campaign period. Manafort [redacted] did not see a downside to haring campaign information, and told Gates that his role in the Campaign would be ""good for bussiness"" and potentially a way to be made whole for work he previously completed in Ukraine. As to Deripaska, Manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with him, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a ""disagreement"" - a reference to one or more outstanding lawsuits. Because of questions about Manafort's credibility and our limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it. The Office did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort's sharing polling data and Russia's intereference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the time of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts.  >...Gates also reported that Manafort instructed him in April 2016 or early May 2016 to send Kilimnik Campaign internal polling and other updates so that Kilimnik, in turn, could share it with Ukrainian oligarchs. Gates understood that the information would also be shared with Deripaska, [redacted]. Gates reported to the Office that he did not know why Manafort wanted him to send polling information, but Gates thought it was a way to showcase Manafort's work, and Manafort wanted to open doors to jobs after the Trump Campaign ended. Gates said that Manafort's intruction included sending internal polling data prepared for the Trump Campaign by pollster Tony Fabrizio. Fabrizio had worked with Manafort for years and was brought into the Campaign by Manafort. Gates states that, in accordance with Manafort's instruction, he periodically sent Kilimnik polling data via WhatsApp; Gates then deleted the communications on a daily basis. Gates further told the Office that, after Manafort left the Campaign in mid-August, Gates sent Kilimnik polling data less frequently and that the data he sent was more publicly available information and less internal data.   >Gate's account about polling data is consistent [redacted] with multiple emails that Kilimnik sent to U.S. associates and press contacts between late July and mid-August of 2016. Those emails reference ""internal polling,"" described the status of the Trump Campaign and Manafort's role in it, and assess Trump's prospects for victory. Manafort did not acknowledge instructing Gates to send Kilimnik internal data, [redacted].  >The Office also obstained contemporaneous emails that shed light on the purpose of the communications with Deripaska and that are consistent with Gates's account. For example in response to a July 7, 2016 email from a Ukrainian reporter about Manafort's failed Deripaska-backed investment, Manafort asked Kilimnik whether there had been any movement on ""this issue with our friend."" Gates states that ""our friend"" likely referred to Deripaska, and Manafort told the Office that the ""issue"" (and ""our biggest interest,"" as stated below) was a solution to the Deripaska-Pericles issue. Kilimnik replied:  >> I am carefully optimistic on the question of our biggest interesting.  >> Our friend [Boyarkin] said there is lately significantly more attention to the campaign in his boss' [Deripaska's] mind, and he will be most likely looking for ways to reach out to you pretty soon, understanding all the time sensitivity. I am more than sure that it will be resolved and we will get back to the original relationship with V.'s boss [Deripaska]  >Eight minutes later, Manafort replied that Kilimnik should tell Boyarkin's ""boss,"" a reference to Deripaska, ""that if he needs private briefings we can accommodate."" Manafort has alleged to the Office that he was willing to brief Deripaska only on public campaign matters and gave an example: Why Trump selected Mike Pence a the Vice-Presidential running mate. Manafort said he never gave Deripaska a briefing. Manafort noted that if Trump won, Deripaska would want to use Manafort to advance whatever interests Deripaska had in the United States and elsewhere.  ________  1) [Fox News - Paul Manafort sentenced on foreign lobbying and witness tampering charges](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/paul-manafort-sentenced-on-foreign-lobbying-and-witness-tampering-charges)  2) [Reuters - Manafort had $10 million loan from Russian oligarch: court filing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-manafort/manafort-had-10-million-loan-from-russian-oligarch-court-filing-idUSKBN1JN2YF)  3) [Washington Examiner - Paul Manafort concedes he gave Trump campaign polling data to the Russians](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/paul-manafort-gave-trump-campaign-data-russians)  4) [Fox News - Judge rules Manafort 'intentionally' lied to Mueller team, voiding plea agreement ](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-rules-manafort-intentionally-lied-to-mueller-team-voiding-plea-agreement)  5) [New York Times - Deripaska and Allies Could Benefit From Sanctions Deal, Document Shows](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/us/politics/oleg-deripaska-russian-sanctions.html)  6) [Department of Justice - Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In the 2016 Presidential Election](https://media.npr.org/assets/news/2019/04/muellerreport.pdf)",2047,0

One thing that people should acknowledge is that the files were legit. The FBI did confirm that. It seems Hunter Biden used nepotism to stumble into these jobs and it seemed like he tried to use his father's name to secure deals. The issue is that there is no proof that Joe Biden was in on it, or that Hunter's strategy worked at all.  The real question is where did these files come from? That's what we should all be focusing on. The laptop repair guy is clearly a GOP operative, and the fall guy here. I'm willing to bet that these Hunter Biden files were obtained through absolutely sketchy means. I think Russia (or some other foreign entity) gave these files to members of the GOP.  Think about it, you now have dirt on a political opponent, obtained illegally through foreign collision, and you have to get them out somehow. You decide to put these files on a laptop, and claim that Hunter Biden personally dropped off the laptop. Of course, we can't prove that it was actually Hunter's laptop, or that he bought it. The entire thing fucking reeks of some dirty GOP/Russian collusion. I think that this aspect is much bigger than the files themselves, which do not actually implicate Joe Biden in any sort of crimes.   I just find it EXTREMELY hard to believe that Hunter dropped off some laptop, with all this dirt on him (including archived text messages), to a guy who just happened to be a GOP operative, then ""forgot"" to pick the laptop back up.

At a time when then candidate Trump had been warned by the FBI that Russians and other foreign adversaries would try to interfere with the election and was asked to alert the FBI of any suspicious overtures to their campaign.^[[1]](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-warned-trump-2016-russians-would-try-infiltrate-his-campaign-n830596) Despite the intelligence briefing then candidate Trump continued to deny any wrong-doing by the Russians during the campaign.^[[2]](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-again-says-u-s-doesn-t-know-if-russia-n670186)  Roger Stone was directed by the Trump Campaign to find out about potential future releases;^[[3]](https://www.scribd.com/document/398210081/Stone-Indictment-012419#from_embed)  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. ROGER JASON STONE, JR.  >4. ROGER JASON STONE, JR. was a political consultant who worked for decades in U.S.  politics and on U.S. political campaigns. STONE was an official on the U.S. presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump (“Trump Campaign”) until in or around August 2015, and maintained regular contact with and publicly supported the Trump Campaign through the 2016 election. 5.   >5. During the summer of 2016, STONE spoke to senior Trump Campaign officials about Organization 1 and information it might have had that would be damaging to the Clinton Campaign. STONE was contacted by senior Trump Campaign officials to inquire about future releases by Organization 1.  >11. By in or around June and July 2016, STONE informed senior Trump Campaign officials that he had information indicating Organization 1 had documents whose release would be damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The head of Organization 1 was located at all relevant times at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, United Kingdom.  >12. After the July 22, 2016 release of stolen DNC emails by Organization 1, a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact STONE about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton Campaign. STONE thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by Organization 1.  >17. On or about October 7, 2016, Organization 1 released the first set of emails stolen from the Clinton Campaign chairman. Shortly after Organization 1’s release, an associate of the high-ranking Trump Campaign official sent a text message to STONE that read “well done.” In subsequent conversations with senior Trump Campaign officials, STONE claimed credit for having correctly predicted the October 7, 2016 release.  Furthermore, over the course of the Special Counsel's investigation into Russian election hacking the government obtained and executed dozens of search warrants. Several of those search warrants were executed on accounts that contained Stone’s direct communications with Wikileaks and Guccifer 2.0 (Russian intelligence officers);^[[4]](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5740797/2-15-19-US-Stone-Related-Case.pdf)  >Certain Netyksho defendants, through a fictitious online persona they created, Guccifer 2.0, also interacted directly with Stone concerning other stolen materials posted separately online.   >...As alleged in the Netyksho indictment, in 2016, the Netyksho defendants stole documents from the DNC, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Clinton campaign chairman. Those defendants then released many of the stolen documents, including through a website maintained by Organization 1. In the course of investigating that activity, the government obtained and executed dozens of search warrants on various accounts used to facilitate the transfer of stolen documents for release, as well as to discuss the timing and promotion of their release. Several of those search warrants were executed on accounts that contained Stone’s communications with Guccifer 2.0 and with Organization 1. Evidence obtained from those search warrants resulted in the allegations that the Netyksho defendants hacked and stole documents for release through intermediaries, including Organization 1, and that Stone lied to a congressional committee investigating, among other things, the activities of Organization 1 regarding those stolen documents. The relevant search warrants, which are being produced to the defendant in discovery in this case, are discussed further in a sealed addendum to this filing.   Moreover, former Trump Campaign adviser Roger Stone was charged on 7 counts including 5 counts for providing false statements meant to mislead Congressional investigators about his communications with Wikileaks;^[[5]](https://www.scribd.com/document/398210081/Stone-Indictment-012419#from_embed)   >COUNTS TWO THROUGH SIX (False Statements)  >43.

yy1m2p,GOP operative found guilty of funneling Russian money to Donald Trump,"I don't think it was ever Hunter Biden's laptop, I don't believe for one minute that even a fueled-by-crack Hunter Biden would create the incriminating videos that we know to exist, store them on the laptop (a laptop with a Beau Biden Foundation sticker affixed), take the laptop to a computer repair shop where ironically a GOP operative worked, mind you a GOP operative who claimed he couldn't visually confirm that it was Hunter himself who dropped of the water damaged laptop because ""his eyesight is bad"", but he was ""pretty sure it was him due to the smell of alcohol"", and Hunter not only never returned to pickup this laptop, but couldn't be reached by phone? We're supposed to believe that a laptop repair tech with eyes so bad that he couldn't confirm the visual identity of a man, but could work on electronics with extremely tiny components and screws? This repair technician also happens to be a GOP operative who knew who Hunter Biden is, but couldn't identify him? He then allegedly contacts the FBI, who order him to hand over the laptop, but not before he secretly clones the hard drive to an external drive, who he gives to Giuliani's lawyer and they share it with the post?  Here's what I think...   1. I don't think Hunter Biden dropped off a water damaged MacBook to a computer repair shop that was also coincidentally run by a GOP operative who was clued in on why the GOP might want dirt on Hunter Biden. I believe that either the Russians managed to hack or otherwise gain access to Hunters email/cloud storage, or got access hacking his laptop or phone, which could have also had both the video shown and emails as most people sync their email to their laptops and phones. I think the Russians managed to get this data and the laptop story is a cover to hide how the information was obtained. It's also feasible that the laptop was stolen from Hunter, hacked, then dropped off at the GOP operative repair shop, who's eyesight was too poor to confirm that it was actually Hunter. Maybe the woman in the video (or another that Hunter partied with) was an operative and stole / cloned the laptop. There is no fucking way I'll be believe that Hunter willingly dropped off his personal laptop at a random computer repair shop, knowing what was on it, crack smoking or not, and then never attempted to get it back, absolutely zero fucking chance. Hunter may have had a substance abuse issue, but he's also quite intelligent and well educated being a Yale law graduate, he also has spent considerable time in finance.   2. I think Hunter did what most other connected Yale grads do, he used his name and sold the idea of access or potential influence in return for business deals / lucrative arrangements, otherwise known as lobbying. Politically connected and extremely wealthy people do this shit all the time, it's almost exclusively how they operate. The saying ""its who you know"" means everything, there are people out there worth billions who have done little more than connect and vouch for people, provide access to important people, get an otherwise unlikely meeting, and peddle influence, I mean that's sort if politics in a nutshell, and is much of what lobbying really is, what is what Hunter has always been, a lobbyist. I think Hunter was just like all the other connected lobbyists, doing the same shit so they don't actually have to work for a living.  I would still argue that all of the questionable lobbying and high-level influence / access issues that Hunter either has done or has been alleged to have done, pales in comparison to what we 100% know Jared and Ivanka did to enrich themselves during Trump's time in office. I don't have proof of Hunter being buddies with MBS, or otherwise arranging lucrative deals with the Saudi's, but somehow if Hunter used his name and clout to milk money out of a Chinese firm connected to the CCP, (news flash, basically every company in China is connected to the CCP) that's somehow worse?",245,0

Standard operating procedure requires the clients ID be photocopied and his signature taken when dropping off ANYTHING for repair. This is to protect our own asses as well as the customers property if it somehow ends up MIA. A receipt is given for the drop off as well as a copy of all the signed materials.  The customer gets a call after the free inspection (or not free depending on the store) and we tell them what is wrong, what it costs to get it fixed and if we should move forward or do they want to pick it up and go elsewhere. This call is typically recorded as evidence to move forward with the repair(on top of the signed documents).  We fix said item and call the customer for pickup(this is when they usually pay for the repairs). However, if after say 3-6 months(of constantly calling and emailing customer to pick it up) the property is considered abandoned. It is cleaned up, wiped and set for sale online or in store.  So far said ""shop"" has not done any of this which makes me feel as if the entire thing was smoke and mirrors or as you said above, a setup.

ym9iut,Supreme Court again declines to block Biden’s student loan relief plan,"In conversations around loan relief, I often see people observing that it is not a solution to the problem. I agree, but I think it is an effective stopgap while we work on solving the problem. If you get a major cut, the solution is getting stitches, but a bandage is better than nothing while you are waiting for them.  I want to borrow from one of my own comments to explain what I think is a possible long-term solution. I work in higher-ed administration, admittedly at a low level, but my experience with budgeting decisions has me convinced that the solution needs to be three-pronged, with one element that I'll save for last being particularly difficult.  First, from a policy perspective, I think we need to forgive existing student loans while, simultaneously, removing the government guarantee on future loans (there are multiple ways of doing this, but I am partial to legislation that would make student loans dischargeable through traditional bankruptcy processes).  This first step raises the problem of making higher-ed only accessible to the upper classes. Without easily accessible loans, many working-class students would be locked out of universities. I think that there are a few solutions to this problem. The one I think is most fitting is transitioning to taxpayer-funded tuition waivers for families making less than $100,000 with a nationally legislated tuition cap. This would have to happen in conjunction with a generally increased level of state funding for universities and colleges makes up my second proposal.  This second element raises its own issues (mainly costs). University budgets, in my experience, are bloated all to hell. It would be a hard sell convincing taxpayers to fund institutions at their current expenditure levels. The problem here I think is the culture around college in the U.S. The two biggest cultural problems I see are:  1. The increased demand for college education by employers as a means of outsourcing training. I worked as a journalist for several years, and frankly, such a job should not require a college degree. Journalists could be effectively trained through intensive apprenticeship programs. I also worked in IT, and frankly, most technical education could also happen on the job. The issue is that companies have felt empowered to outsource job training to colleges and universities. College, in my view, should not be a place people go to gain specific job skills. It should instead be a place where students can learn critical thinking and engage with scientific, humanist, and/or artistic thinking. Basically, college should be a place for education in and the debate of ideas that are essential for the advancement of society but aren't immediately useful in terms of production. In my view, someone who wants to be an engineer should be provided an engineering apprenticeship. Someone who wants to be a research physicist, on the other hand, would be a good candidate for university education under this proposed system.  2. Americans have gotten used to viewing college campuses as all-inclusive resorts. There is no reason a university needs a pool or sports team or gym. These are all resources that can be found off campus, but we have a culture of viewing campus as almost a separate community from the one it exists in/next to. A lot of the budget bloat I see is in these areas. What I think we need to do is reduce student expectations of amenities on campus and encourage greater student engagement with the existing community and its resources.  My third proposal is that we need to change the cultural problems I identified above. However, this is where I reach a dead end. I am unsure of how to change these norms. Nonetheless, I am optimistic that they can be changed with the right policy incentives.  Edited for subject-verb agreement.",31,0

You'll rarely get a capitulation, but I have seen people change their minds over time and tell me later that they realized I was right and it helped change their mind.   In-person, I don't even like to tell people things. I take a Socratic approach, and rather force them to have to defend their position. Once you've poked enough holes, they'll have to reassess (if they're honest with themselves). Of course, some people just terminate their thought with a cliché and move on with their lives, but I'd argue that's a tiny portion of all folk.  For example, whenever I hear someone laud the Republican's economic policy, I just earnestly ask them what they mean. Something like, ""oh wow, not something the mainstream media reports. I'd like to know more about what Republicans can do for the economy."" Then it just precipitates there as none of them can even rudimentarily trace what a specific Republican policy actually does to help the economy. Tax cuts? ""Billionaires are better at spending their money."" If that's the case, why do they constantly need the government to bail out their companies? Why do they need government subsidies to gain their wealth? ""Well, they create jobs."" Do they not also take jobs away? It was the rich who out-sourced and automated, who took yer jobs.   Now, and important thing to always remember about the Socratic method is you will absolutely and invariably piss people off. Socrates pissed off enough of Athens to get himself executed, literally just for questioning people's assumptions. Given that right-wing policy exists solely based on vaguery, fantasy, and lack of actionable understanding, they tend to get very pissed off very quick. Or they just get exhausted having to use the critical faculties they never flex and give up.",46,0

I’m pretty social and will always try to strike up a conversation with my riders. With this guy we talked about everything. Hunting, guns, his failing marriage, his job as a union electrician, how he was abused as a kid. A lot of deep stuff.  The second we pulled up to his house he was saying that I should come in for a few beers and just hangout. That’s when I turned to him to decline the offer and he saw that I was wearing a mask, and his whole demeanor changed instantly.

During the 2017 special election turn out increased by 18% in these counties and these same counties had ≤50% red votes, most being less than by quite a bit. The reddest counties saw a 45% drop in turnout from 2016 to 2017; Though compared to the 2014 gubernatorial race it was only a 5% decrease in a race with a 14% increase in turnout from 2014. The 2014 gubernatorial race was another off year election which makes for a fair comparative basis. Special elections regularly see lower than normal voter turnout.

Left-leaning Americans need to party after election wins, like we saw in Brazil.  Ok, so maybe Joe Biden isn't your cup of tea. Maybe Democrats aren't quite as left-wing or right-wing as you'd like. But you know who's worse? The nutjobs on the far right, who have no ideas and are basically in a Christian-themed personality cult that worships their Dear Leader, who's a complete moron (at best). Oh, and these guys also believe any election they lose is ""rigged.""  I think a lot of people were worried about Brazil's election, and whether Bolsonaro would concede, or the military would step in. But so far, things seem to be going well. And I think it's because when Lula won, people went out an celebrated.  https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/oct/31/lula-da-silva-brazilians-celebrate-leftist-leaders-narrow-victory-video  It's a lot harder to overturn an election when you see how many people you're really up against. And it's also way harder to whine about election fraud when those people that voted get out and march (just think of how many people justify their election fraud BS with the fact that Trump had way bigger cult rallies during the pandemic).  So, with Arizona finally called and Nevada looking like it's probably going to go Dem, if just barely (and there's sure to be plenty of whining), I think it'd be great for thousands of Americans to take to the streets to celebrate these victories. Don't like Biden? Bring a sign that says ""Biden sucks, but he's way better than these clowns"" or something more catchy than that. I'll leave the specifics to you, but I think this show of enthusiasm might help people realize that their far right bullshit is way less popular than they think it is.

Fetterman's health worries me. Plus, yet again, PA is a carbon copy of MI, an old ""Blue Wall"" state that's prone to flip-flopping on a dime due to its slow demographic turnover.    On the whole, out of these 4, I'd feel most comfortable with Whitmer running. She's not super corporatist, not all that old, is intelligent and intentional in her usage of social media, incredibly popular, and presses all the right buttons in terms of focused on and acted upon issues. To me, she is the clear up and coming star in the Democratic party, and she has been for years. I just really don't want to lose her seat in MI. That said, it may be worth it to get a legit shot at the presidency...",51,0

If Twitter becomes another Truth Social or Parler, it’s more or less fine to advertise there because no one will be pissed to see their ads. No one will be blowing up their replies and getting them trending, which in turn runs the risk of sparking articles in bigger publications and possibly even boycotts and tanked stock prices.

I mean just look at all this shit, and now the GOP led House isn't going to make looking into the Mar-a-lago documents a priority, just enabling foreign agents to run amok in our government.  [37 times - that we know of - where Trump was caught sucking Russia's dick](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/17/politics/trump-soft-on-russia)  *Trump is and has been under Putin’s thumb for decades, much of it through the Russian Mafia:*  *Trump was over a billion in debt and the Russians bailed him out.*  *► Trump was first compromised by the Russians in the 80s. In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use Trump real estate to launder money. In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but evolved into something far bigger.*  *► In 1984, David Bogatin — a convicted Russian mobster and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss — met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. (NY Times, Apr 30, 1992)*  *► Felix Sater is a Russian-born former mobster, and former managing director of NY real estate conglomerate Bayrock Group LLC located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. He is a convict who became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former ""fixer"" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.*  *► Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia. Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.*  *► In July 2008, the height of the housing bust, Trump sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian oligarch. Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. The sale price was nearly $54 million more than Trump had paid for the property. Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had plummeted in value.*  *► Semion Mogilevich was the brains behind the Russian Mafia. Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money. That means Russian Mafia operatives have been part of his fortune for years. Many of them owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties. They were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel.*  *► From Craig Unger's AMA: ""Early on, a source told me that all this was tied to Semion Mogilevich, the powerful Russian mobster. I had never even heard of him, but I immediately went to a database that listed the owners of all properties in NY state and looked up all the Trump properties. Every time I found a Russian sounding name, I would Google, and add Mogilevich. When you do investigative reporting, you anticipate drilling a number of dry holes, but almost everyone I googled turned out to be a Russian mobster. Again and again. If you know New York you don't expect Trump Tower to be a high crime neighborhood, but there were far too many Russian mobsters in Trump properties for it to be a coincidence.""*  *► So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, was living at Trump Tower*  *► According to a Bloomberg investigation (3/16/2017) into Trump World Tower, “a third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and neighboring states.”*  *► In 2013, Federal agents busted an “ultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal poker ring” run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. They operated card games, illegal gambling websites, and a global sports book and laundered more than $100 million. A condo directly below one owned by Trump reportedly served as HQ for a “sophisticated money-laundering scheme” connected to Semion Mogilevich.*  *► The Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. Russia is a mafia state. that is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.*  *► Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive. Now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the FBI described Kislin as having ties tot he Russian mob. Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.*  *► A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. The NRA got as much as $70M from Russia, then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnel got millions from Leonard Blavatnik. In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay. Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money.*  *► At the Cityscape USA’s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, saying ""...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.""*  *► Eric Trump told golf reporter James Dodson in 2014 that the Trump Organization was able to expand during the financial crisis because “We don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.”*  *► Russian oligarchs co-signed Trump’s Deutsche bank loans.*  *Trump now gleefully takes cues from Putin:*  *► At the end of 2018, Putin and his allies started making a strong push for a resolution that would justify their country’s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and reverse an 1989 vote backed by Mikhail Gorbachev that condemned it. The Putinists’ goal was to pass the resolution by Feb. There is no one on this side of the Atlantic who thinks the USSR was justified in invading Afghanistan. And out of nowhere, on January 2nd, Trump came out strongly supporting Russia's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.*  *► Trump went against American intelligence on North Korean missiles. He told the FBI he didn't believe their intelligence because Putin told him otherwise. ""I don't care, I believe Putin""*  *► Trump met in secret with Putin the G20 summit in November 2018, without note takers. 19 days later, he announced a withdrawal from Syria. As a note, Trump conducted FIVE completely private meetings and conferences with Putin, and has gone to great lengths to prevent literally anyone, even people in his administration, from learning what was discussed.*  *► Trump refused to enforce sanctions legally codified into law - and in some cases reversed standing sanctions on Russian companies.*  *► He has denounced his own intelligence agencies in a press conference with Putin on election meddling - and publicly endorsed Putin's version of events.*  *► Trump pulled out of the INF treaty with no explanation, which allows Putin to create long-range hypersonic missiles that threaten Europe with impunity. The US already has all the weaponry that the INF would ban the development of, so this offers us literally nothing, while allowing Russia to develop powerful new weapons to challenge our allies.*  *► Demanded Russia get invited back into G7*  *► Pushed the CIA to give American intelligence to the Kremlin.*  *► Withdrew from the Open Skies treaty*  *► Received intelligence in 2019 that Russia was paying bounties for dead American soldiers, and hasn't done anything about it by the time of this writing.*  *► Announced troop withdrawal from Germany (America's missile defense from Russia and forward operating base against Russian aggression)*  *► And of course, Trump continues to threaten to pull out of NATO, a move so catastrophically stupid, so inconceivably cosmically myopic, I truly can't express the profundity of the idiocy. Suffice to say, pulling out of NATO would be like the only guy in a prison yard with a shotgun just throwing it over the fence for absolutely no reason, suddenly giving the people with crude homemade shivs complete power.*",186,0

This conviction now essentially helps confirms what I've suspected for years. A huge chunk of the modern English internet's political views/arguments has been influenced by foreign accounts, [more than I think most viewers realize.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaLago/comments/875jsx/some_insight_into_the_russian_psyop_on_4chan_as_i/) You can really start to see it take off around early 2012 in particular.

I've long suspected that most of our online debates about issues were being interfered with on modern social media, and it pre-dates Trump's campaigns.

The problem with social media documentaries is that hard proof is very difficult to solidify. HBO did a fantastic job with the QAnon doc because they went straight to the source and successfully played on the egos of the Watkins to get to the core of things, but that's much harder to do if we're talking about things that happened before 2016. Most of the evidence we can obtain is circumstantial even if it's often public. I've been trying to connect threads for years now, and I believe a lot more has come out to make it clear, but that doesn't mean it'll be easy to explain this to your average TV viewer.

Articles like these invariably refer to manufacturers that sell goods to stores(where the above commenter works--stores don't have MSRP manufacturer suggested retail price). Upon close reading, rarely do articles talk about stores that sell goods to you the individual consumers.  Manufacturers are ridiculous in their price gouging but most states' anti-price gouging laws are only enforced on stores. And since stores MUST carry household name brands like Pepsi, but customers can shop ANY store that sells Pepsi, stores MUST 'eat' Pepsi inflation or lose customers to other stores.  No matter how high Pepsi raises prices, Wal-Mart can't just stop selling Pepsi. And unfortunately once Pepsi does it, Coke will too, leading to manufacturer-wide price gouging with no loss of customers.

Though in reality, his father in law started it and it fell to him through marriage and sexism and wouldn't exist without ~~government handouts~~ federal subsidies.   I had to train his 30 year old son how to manage an accounting department. And yes, he had zero accounting, math, or management experience. But he promised to stop getting black out drunk in strip clubs until the cops had to drive him home, so Daddy gave him a $500k a year job. Then, Daddy hired me to train him/do it for him, though I *also* have no accounting experience. But money is money, so I said yes.  He decided he didn't like having a baby sitter, and started having secret meetings without telling me on day one.    Within a month, he threw away new desks and chairs and replaced them with standing desks, but only for the admin assistants (all women). Then, ordered all their desks moved against the wall opposite his office. All so they'd have to stand all day and he could look at their asses.  He even invited his favorite lackeys to watch with him as a reward. I had to get his dad's lawyers to explain to them both how fucking stupid this was, though it didn't make a difference since *someone* already pointed the women to a sexual harassment lawyer in the city.   Long story short, several five and six figure settlements later, those young ladies had a great financial head start in life and the dumb creep learned nothing from the  experience. He continues to be very rich and very awful from what I hear. His older sister graduated an Ivy with a 4.0 and has Fortune 50 experience, but he's still in line to inherit the main family business.

Peltola ran an amazing race, but Rank Choice was also vital to her strategy (as it rightly should).   This is the power of Rank Choice voting. It stifles extremism.

In fact, with the largest third party in the US being the Libertarian party, RCV would quite likely often redistribute votes from a candidate that was spoiling a Republican. The paranoia seems to have originated just from a couple of specific instances recently where RCV has been implemented (2010/2014 Maine governor election elected a nutjob w/ a minority of the vote, leading to implementation of RCV in the state, which then won Jared Golden (D-ME2) a house seat in 2018). That's specific to Maine politics and RCV could just as easily win R's seats elsewhere.

Mining is going to happen. It is needed to supply all the minerals that feed into renewable energy as well as fossil fuel energy.  Pushing mining out of countries with strong environmental standards is going to increase environmental degradation. At best, mines will be established in areas with less stringent regulations. At worst, illegal mining will require new export areas, which means disturbing new access corridors and new, unreviewed transportation.  Mining is not sustainable. It is extracting a resource that will be depleted. The resource needs to be extracted in a manner that supports reclamation, and mining companies need to leave some sort of land use or industry in that place behind that still supports the community.   I like all of the amenities I get from current society. I get that they come at a cost and we are rapidly spending our hours of ancient sunlight.

Obviously it's anecdotal, and it's possible that if you only met a limited number of people that they could all have been delightful.   However, We know that not every Black or Hispanic person is respectful or delightful, they are as diverse as any other group of people, and that is the idea we want to support. The issue comes up when someone who has the opposite view sees the comment and can easily dismiss it by pointing out all the examples of a black and Hispanic person not being respectful or delightful. And using that to discount any positive intention you had.  And if you're a ""Gringo"", you can see how that comment is an insult and not inviting to the positive sentiment you're trying to share. Just imagine switching those around ""Every Gringo person I know are the most respectful and delightful people ever. Honestly they are way more fun to hang out with then Blacks or Hispanics"". Not fun to be at the end of that sentence.  It's the same issue when saying all military are heroes or giving any group a monolithic characteristic (positive or negative), it makes it hard to highlight the  true diversity of that group and see the individuals for who they are (complicated people with diverse characteristics).",27,0

z37b13,Sarah Palin Just Lost a 50-Year GOP Seat to Alaska’s First Native Rep,"Black men gained the right to vote in 1870 (in theory but there were and are lots of obstacles). Women would gain the right to vote 50 years later. Conservatives spent years and a lot of money trying to keep both of those things from happening, and neither was easy. It’s not correct to say that white men “allowed” women to vote directly after that. Women were still being thrown in jail for attempting it (as were black men even when it was legal).   Having said that - yes, there was a lot of racism entwined with women’s suffrage too, as with all of history. Suffragists were aligned with the abolitionist movement in the early years, but there was a [split in the movement](https://www.nps.gov/articles/african-american-women-and-the-nineteenth-amendment.htm) when the 15th amendment was proposed. A movement that was at one point somewhat unified and pushing for equal rights for all, split and women like Susan B. Anthony said that Black men shouldn’t be able to vote before white women. That created a lot of controversy. So yeah, there was definitely racism driving the dialogue at that time.   There were also plenty of women protesting *against* women’s suffrage. Women who didn’t think women should have the right to vote. It’s a lot like women today who don’t think women should have reproductive rights. It seems stupid, but the patriarchy is engrained in our lives and in our minds.   The bottom line is that humanity is one giant mess and history is a mess. But these rights were hard won, over many years, by imperfect people. And we can’t dismiss that by saying that white men “gave” rights to people because it occurred to them to do so. Or because women are so easily “brainwashed” that it wasn’t a threat. Or for any other reason. People paid for those rights with their blood and their lives, they weren’t freely given. And they were met with resistance for many years event after both of those amendments were passed. And in some places still are. Voter suppression is real, and it affects Black Americans disproportionately. It’s messed up. Let’s just not frame history in such a way that white men “give” everyone else rights.",65,0

It's not like old school hard rock mining where they're finding a vein, or even like coal where they're open pit mining but they're still more or less just digging it out of the ground directly same as 100 years ago but on a massive scale.    Placer deposits are sedimentary, so lots of different minerals.  They dig it up, incinerate to get most things out and process it chemically to refine the metals.  But because of how it's distributed it takes a lot of ore to get to the refined metal, Pebble Mine was going to produce at least ten billion tons of ore.  And what always happens with these mines is once it's built they find a whole lot more because they have the time to study it and literally unearth it.

A former friend of mine married a Chinese woman with a PhD in like...some egghead science I don't understand. Honestly, I can't remember what her profession was only that she was insanely intelligent, talented, and filthy rich. He, a jackboot type who became a full on self avowed Nazi, spent the years following trump dismantling this poor woman's life. He forced her to quit her job and would abuse her. The abuse turned her into a ""bang maid"" that was worthy of a real man according to him. I don't know, have you ever seen F is for Family? The military dude from Vietnam? He is that psycho but claims to be a Nazi.   The last straw was he tried to sexually assault her in front of us. I threw him out. Shortly after, I found out about the above abuse. Anyway, she managed to escape him with some not so gentle ribbing from members of his former group. I think he's homeless holed up in a car with a shit load of guns now and I wouldn't be surprised if he was involved in some way with January 6. The dude is a dime a dozen and is truly scary.  The moral of the story is, marrying a woman of color doesn't make you any less of a horrible racist and homophobist. He's not voting strictly because he hates gay people.

The Defense of Marriage Act (which dealt only with gay marriage) was passed with broad bipartisan support during the Clinton administration in 1996.

This is a concept that actually extends beyond just America as well to other Anglo-Saxon dominated cultures. You can see this clearly in the experience of Meghan Markle— who was very quickly reminded of her blackness upon marrying Harry, when otherwise many people would have never thought of her that way.   Another example is Obama who became fully “black” instead of just “mixed” as soon as he ascended to a certain level of power.

yxmksl,Mitch McConnell votes against interracial marriage despite Asian wife,"It could all be blamed on the practical effect of the existence of the Senate. We look at popular vote maps now and scream ""land doesn't vote,"" but in the senate, it absolutely DOES. Moreover, there's the filibuster, which requires not a majority, but 60 senate votes to overcome. If you don't have 60 votes to even debate the bill, it's a non-starter. Also here's a fun historical chart showing how rare a unified government is (though my observation: it was way less uncommon before Nixon in 1969, and naturally the country rallied behind GW after 9/11 - wars do have that effect.) [https://history.house.gov/Institution/Presidents-Coinciding/Party-Government/](https://history.house.gov/Institution/Presidents-Coinciding/Party-Government/)  Well, what happened around 1969? I'm sure [The Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/oasam/civil-rights-center/statutes/civil-rights-act-of-1964) had nothing to do with it.  Anyway since land DOES vote in the Senate, and therefore it's hard to get congress to agree on anything, coupled by the increasing partisanship of the last 30 years, none of this basic shit gets written into actual law because a minority of people with a disproportionate representation don't want it.  And so, the Supreme Court started to fill the gaps, and make judicial rulings in favor of civil rights, interpreting other rights to apply to them. They came to the right conclusion through the only way in their power. And THIS court is saying, it doesn't matter what conclusion you came to or why, if your legal ruling was faulty, your conclusion must be thrown out.  That they are even willing to hear cases like these mean they are willing to rule against the conclusions. We currently have a court who is curtailing the interpretations of rights from anyone not explicitly named, not ruling on if they should be properly expanded to include such a group.

yxmksl,Mitch McConnell votes against interracial marriage despite Asian wife,"I do believe there is hope to be had. Boomers, mostly without realizing it, sold their grandchildrens' futures. Boomers grew up in a post-war economy with high taxes on the wealthy that funded the middle class, and trades were a vital part of society in the pre-internet era. They largely thought, I worked to get mine, therefore work creates wealth, therefore lack of wealth is lack of work, and so they would vote to decrease spending on government support programs because anyone worthy didn't need them.  In reality, they didn't work TO get theirs, they worked AND got theirs, from a financial form of government that created a healthy functioning society.  But the explosion of the internet is a factor here too, because now employment future often is expected to involve higher education, so you've got most kids going to a second set of high school years at five figures per year, starting off in the hole before they even begin. Each generation has less than the one before it, and their grandparents keep talking about wanting to cut taxes and make their 401ks go brrrr (mind you, with a healthy social security program you wouldn't need so much 401k BUT I DIGRESS).  When you steal their futures and then steal their rights, the youth gets pissed off. And there are more of them every year, while boomers are going to keep dying off.  I believe it's a matter of holding authoritarianism at bay until the youth take over, and that could take as few as 2-4 more election cycles if we keep them engaged.

z3nem2,Herschel Walker Committed 'Election Fraud' With Texas Residence: Analysts,"Real talk for the curious-it stands for ArmaLite Rifle 15. The AR-15 model line is a popular series of rifles very similar to the old M16 rifle but made for civilian use. Colt (they bought ArmaLite) does not retain the *copyright* to the Rifle *design*, but does retain the *trademark* and is the only manufacturer that can label rifles AR-15's.  The actual pattern line is rather extensive, and the barrel, sights, and attachments vary a lot of course-the common features are in the internals of the rifle. Because the design is in public domain you often see a lot of distinction without difference nonsense about how the rifle used in a shooting wasn't technically an AR-15 despite being *functionally* identical.  It's particularly popular because you can go right from a M16 to an AR-15 and not notice the difference, and the M16 was used in Vietnam and variants have had service roles since.  Also, assault rifles are rifles with select fire and automatic or near-automatic capabilities; I've seen people push for burst fire capable rifles to count. It's functionally meaningless when talking about mass shootings, as semi-automatic rifles are functional identical in time to kill; aiming is the time limiting factor, not rate of fire.

z3nem2,Herschel Walker Committed 'Election Fraud' With Texas Residence: Analysts,"He's a black guy being controlled by two white guys. That's precisely what they want to see running the country.  Walker is a microcosm of the Republican vision for minority representation-an intellectually disarmed physical entertainer barely aware of his surroundings doing whatever white people tell him to do.  And if that paints an unflattering profile of American football-remember; *Donald Fucking Trump* owned the New Jersey Generals (Walkers first team) as part of the USFL, before the entire football league disintegrated as part of a failed legal bid to challenge the NFL under antitrust laws and eventually force a merger (it's Donald Trump, so of course it was corrupt, nonsensical, and failed) before he was drafted to the NFL under the Cowboys.  ...Whose owner at the time was an arch conservative famous for pushing through a ""welcome to Dallas"" article highly critical of Kennedy *hours* before he was shot. He then sold the team to Jerry Jones. A man who participated in bullying the Little Rock Six, which he claims he was just there to ""observe"".  I'm sure there were *many* ""observers"" of the Little Rock Six today.  In other words, if you trace Walker's career, you see that he's literally been controlled and exploited by ultra-rich conservative businessmen for profit from the very start of his career. A cabal of rich white guys traded him around from city to city to participate in the blood sport that destroyed his brain...  Like a slave.

They may hear it and give Trump another do over.",798,0
yj9c4y,Supreme Court temporarily blocks Trump tax records from being given to Congress,"So when a court rules that something has to be done and the losing party doesn't want that, they can appeal to a higher court. The question is: What happens in the meantime? Should the previous ruling be implemented? Or should it be held back until the appeals process is finished?  In some cases, when the situation is easily reversed, the ruling can simply be implemented. If I sue you over some amount of money and I win, I get to keep (or receive) the money and if the appeal comes out the other way, I simply hand the money over to you.  But it gets murky when it's harder to revert such a transfer. In the case of documents containing private information, there is no way to ""unrelease"" the documents once the other party has received them (and studied them).  So what you do when you appeal (to the Court of Appeals or afterwards to SCOTUS) is that you file for a stay of the order of the lower court. Such a stay will pause the previous ruling from being implemented until the appeals process is completed (which may be with an appeal not even being taken up by SCOTUS).  In this case, Trump petitioned SCOTUS to freeze the ruling while he files an appeal. SCOTUS (technically, it's just a single Justice as each court circuit has its own Justice who handles such emergency filings, but they can involve the full court) can simply deny or grant it outright or can request a reply from the other party and then rule.  Right now, Chief Justice Roberts decided to ask the other side to file their response as to why the previous ruling needs to be implemented right away and he will then decide whether or not to grant the stay. If granted, it's not yet a final decision, just a temporary hold. Trump then has to complete his appeal petition for the Supreme Court and they have to decide to take up the case (most cases are declined by SCOTUS). If SCOTUS takes up the case, then both sides get to argue over the merits and a ruling is made (this would take months if not more). If SCOTUS declines to take up the case, the previous ruling holds (which orders the release of the documents).  The situation is shitty, but I can see the reasoning behind this current order. You can't ""unrelease"" documents if the case ends up going for Trump in the end. If you don't want some personal information revealed, then first having it revealed and only later winning a court case that says that it shouldn't have been revealed in the first place won't do you any good as the damage is done.  If there's one thing that Trump is good in (and there probably aren't many more) is dragging stuff like this out for a very long time by throwing every procedural trick in the book at it. Probably at the cost of a lot of legal fees.",280,0

On the contrary it was the reason there were two viable republicans in the race.

They then say ""Okay, D lost,"" because they have the fewest first-place votes.  Then election officials take all the ballots who had D as the favorite (in the example, this is one ballot).  They take the second-place vote from there and score it for that candidate.  So let's say our D voter had C as second choice.  Now the tally is 30% for A, 30% for B, and 40% for C (because C has 3 first-place votes PLUS the one from the D ballot).  Then they look at who's last again.  My example has a tie between A and B, but in real life that's unlikely and I'm not retyping this, so they take last place, look at their second choice (or third choice if both first and second have been eliminated) and reassign those votes until someone gets over 50%.",4,0

Eventually you have to reach a point where you accept that everyone born prior to a certain date are **all** going to be ignorant like that, in the same manner that a few generations ago it is highly likely that your ancestors were uneducated, illiterate racists too - because that was the social understanding of the time.   Strangers *were* dangerous in eras where assistance wasn't as simple as reaching into your pocket and pulling out a computer that you walk around with connected to our entire species' culminative knowledge, and calling the police. Fear of the unknown was a very real thing.  Not excusing his fucked up views, but eventually you have to view people at the time period they lived in, not the time period *you* do. If people and society *never* changed, that would be a greater worry.",132,0

The whole point of mass voting is that when you ask a large enough group of people what the answer is to one thing or another, the majority of that group tends to pick the right answer far more often than not. Ranked choice puts that to the forefront. Which is why it wont ever happen as a federal mandate, because it would require both sides to actually put their best people forward. And that means taking up risk that their best isn't enough. Neither side is sending their best, what they're sending are the people most able to muck up the system and put it to a stand still.

Focusing on making the other person look bad, is mainly effective if you are the only other choice.  With ranked choice ranking you need to actually get your base want to vote you specifically, and also convince others candidates voter bases why you should be their second choice.

But a group of firefighters in Houston took the clothing rule to court in 2018 after they were asked to leave a polling location for wearing T-shirts that supported a proposition that didn’t appear on the ballot that year.*      *After a lengthy legal battle, the federal judge ruled in favor of the firefighters. Now, voters are allowed to wear political shirts supporting a candidate or measure — so long as they do not appear on the ballot in the current election.*      *“For example, if somebody wants to wear a Reagan/Bush or Clinton/Gore shirt, those folks are not currently on the ballot, so they can wear political apparel from past elections or elections not currently on the ballot,” Taylor said.*      *However, wearing shirts that support O’Rourke, Abbott or other candidates running in this year’s midterms is still illegal. Wearing clothing related to something on the ballot is restricted not only at the polls, but also within 100 feet of the polling location and is considered a type of “electioneering.”*      *“Electioneering is anything that compels or attempts to compel someone for or against a candidate or measure that’s on the ballot,” Taylor said.*      *Can I wear a MAGA hat?*      *Yes, you can, since former President Donald Trump is not running in the 2022 midterm elections and will not appear on the ballot.*      *“If someone wants to wear a Make America Great Again hat, that’s protected speech under this court ruling,” Taylor said.*  Court rulings could change this in the future.",142,0

Guns can seem as ubiquitous as cars in most of Texas.  [An estimated 45.70% of Texans own guns.](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/gun-ownership-rates-by-state/)  [The population of Texas is around 29.53 million people.](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/TX)  That works out to be about 13.5 million gun owners in the state.

yt8o59,"5 months after the worst school shooting in Texas history, pro-gun Gov. Greg Abbott easily triumphed in Uvalde County","This is my 11pt plan that I send my my Congress critters on a quarterly basis, minus 4-A, since it's still in development. So far they have not taken it into advisement. Want to reduce violence in our society and not infringe on the second amendment? Let's go!  1) Nationally funded, locally available, free gun safety classes for anyone who wants them. This is voluntary to attend. This would also be offered as a high school class similar to Driver's Ed. Focus will be on how to make safe/unload common weapon platforms along with basic marksmanship. It should also discuss common types of self defense scenarios, situational awareness, verbal de-escalation, and the legal consequences of using a defensive firearm. A hunter's safety course and stop the bleed component should also be included. Any range that offers this course gets a tax rebate per person who takes the class. Americans should be familiar with gun safety, we have more guns than people in our country. Hopefully this also helps some people realize that they are not magical murder machines, and others that they are not a talisman that gets you women and makes your dick hard. Return firearms to the category they belong in: tools. This benefits the children of both the anti-gun crowd, since their kids are not often actually taught this factual information, and the pro-gun crowd, who tend to fetishize firearms. Information kills bias, start that process early.  2) National grants given to every county/municipality for the creation and maintenance of a public gun range that is free to use. They can be privately contracted out so long as they offer the course above and remain free for anyone to use. They can offer private classes/firearm rentals/ammo sales etc to help fund themselves as well, but must maintain equal accomodations. This helps facilitate point 1.  3) Raise the Federal age to purchase ANY firearm to 21 years for anyone who has not attended the class in point 1. Attending the class gets you access to firearms at age 18. I believe this would motivate most municipalities to set up the classes and ranges quickly and get people to attend them with minimal complaint. Any state that fails to get their public ranges up and running will have their federal DOT funds withheld. Nice try, NY, CA, MA, and NJ...  4) Residents of the USA who sign up for their selective service (which will now be gender/disability neutral) are registered to vote automatically and cannot be purged from voter rolls without a felony conviction or a valid death certificate.  4a) I have a whole theory about how we can establish a voluntary service corps based around jobs training, community service, and rolling teach for America under the same umbrella. This two year service period would be gender and ability blind. Everything from cutting and maintaining trails in national parks to assisting at-risk communities with basic services. Service would get you access to the GI bill to fund your education or vocational training, as well as allow you access to enter the military as a commissioned officer should you choose to. That's less firearms related, but might help close the education gap for disadvantaged communities while directing federal resources into those communities at the same time. The US requires advanced citizenship, let's instill that in our coming generations.  5) Universal healthcare, including mental health, available to everyone in the US regardless of legal status. Either through Medicare for all, the establishment of a National Health Service, or some other method. We need to destigmatize mental healthcare for young men especially. Asking for help should be one of the defining hallmarks of masculinity in a democracy.  6) End the war on drugs. Prohibition does not work, and addiction is a disease. Treat it like one. Moreover, reducing financial incentives for gang and street level violence will be beneficial to the public as a whole and reduce ""gun crime"". Commute the sentences of all current drug felons, and give them full pardons on all non-violent drug convictions.  7) Open the NICS background check system to everyone as a free service available via mobile app. This is strictly a ""Go/No Go"" system without a detailed report. This can be autogenerated with a QR code link so that the ""buyer"" initiates the background check in real time without giving private information to the seller such as SS number, etc. There is no reason for a private sale to go forward without a background check if the system is free and easy to use. This closes the ""gun show/truck bed"" loophole.  8) Raise the minimum wage to a living wage, and get people out of poverty. Alternatively, use a universal basic income system to give people a baseline quality of life. Start with Yang's UBI proposal paid for with a VAT and tune it to the American economy. Systematic inequality kills more people every year than guns do. Our most gun violence-ridden areas of the nation are caused by issues of economics.  9) Remove silencers and SBR/SBS from the NFA. No more extra taxes for cosmetic features and shortened barrels. Suppressors have valid legal uses such as hunting and preventing hearing loss. This law only restricts these items to the wealthy, and serves no public safety function. This is a prime example of how ""gun control"" is classist.

Many Republicans inhabit the engineering, statistician, and business departments at many schools that I've been to. More than most people realize. You need critical thinking in those roles.  What's actually going on is a complete and total change in epistemic morals and values. They prioritize power and war (with democrats) over peace and coalition building. And so they can ignore critical thinking in order to build their first priorities. This has actually been observed in Great Apes btw. Chimpanzees for instance will often prioritize ingroup dynamics over rational behavior because your chances of survival are actually better if the group is strong.  You have that ingroup identity built on a foundation of lies from fox news. That started out reasonable, and has become lunatic over decades. You could probably do the same thing with democrats if you spent twenty years slowly suggesting a change in them.  The real turd here is we live with childish Ideologues who decided that nothing needs to be regulated and it is an all or nothing society; so we allowed fox news to grow dissent in our own borders and then let that movement build a robust network over an unregulated internet over a decade.

Healthcare is big here . Also 3M and Target.     I will say housing is nuts right now here, just like everywhere  Granted it was bad when we bought though. From the first time we looked at homes before moving until buying housing went up like 25-60k 5 years ago. Now it's probably more like 100-200k depending on where you look. So a 250-300kk home in a decent neighborhood a few years ago is now 350-450k.     No tax on clothes or food. However winter is expensive in other ways. Tires, clothes, heat. As long as you buy really good jackets it's worth the money. My $300 North face goose down is almost 6 years old now. Still great, so worth it.    The people here are hit or miss. Very dry. Not very emotional and hard to break into friend groups. Or at least that is how me and my wife feel. It isn't the case for everyone but the people here are very stand offish. Minnesota nice is a real thing but I could talk to a stranger in a store check out line in Mississippi for 20 mins and here I feel like i am violating people when just making friendly small talk lol.   But i love it here. It flurried today around 25 and the cold air is just awesome to breath it. Not great for skin, but when it snows here it's awesome.",7,0

We live in a god damn red state where I remember people didn't even believe in COVID for a good while, so personally I would hedge my bets on the number being higher.  But even if it isn't, the blood price of 20,000 sacrifices to the god called Economy wouldn't have been enough in their mind to shut shit down.

yt8o59,"5 months after the worst school shooting in Texas history, pro-gun Gov. Greg Abbott easily triumphed in Uvalde County","Another issue is the fundamental misunderstanding of a lot of gun culture from folks outside of the culture. When you’re inside of it and you know the details, you can recognize how certain “military style weapons“ really just have a black paint job and look scary, but have the exact  same capacity, capabilities, etc. as your dad’s or Grandfather’s hunting rifle. 22 caliber ammunition really isn’t that big of a deal compared to 30-06, which typically delivers something on the order of 2 to 3 times as much energy to the target. I am not in the culture, and I don’t know it all that well, but the fact that the AR platform is catching so much heat in the media helps drive a sense of alienation.   When you are in the middle of something, and you see a news report that you know it’s just flat out full of BS, you tend not to trust that news organization anymore. I think that’s a big part of what’s driving the divide. Never mind the fact that for many parts of America we use these as tools, like a chainsaw or an ax.",17,0
yt8o59,"5 months after the worst school shooting in Texas history, pro-gun Gov.

There were already two Supreme court cases where they sided with states against the federal government & the tenth amendment specifically creates states rights - it was already an established precedent. By a lot.   But somehow they’ve ended up on this twisted line of reasoning where the *separate country* wrote *in their constitution* that no state could ever ban slavery… and that somehow makes them a champion of states’ rights.   So I’ve stopped using that line. They’re not just excusing racism - they’re **flat out lying**.,8,0

yt8o59,"5 months after the worst school shooting in Texas history, pro-gun Gov. Greg Abbott easily triumphed in Uvalde County","Yeah, politics in America are more of an urban-suburban-rural divide. Cities reliably go Democrat since Republicans are outright hostile towards cities (everything from vilifying them as cesspools of crime committed by ""those people,"" to acting like mass transit is some kind of ""boondoggle,"" as if the suburban highways they love to fund lavishly are just the natural order of life). Suburbs can be a mixed bag--you definitely have a lot of the angsty style conservatives who think paying taxes is a ""scam"" or whatever, but you also have highly-educated liberals. And then rural areas are typically red due to messaging about ""traditional values,"" but you certainly have a handful of those artsy small towns.  This formula seems to hold pretty consistent across America. Think of New York--you have the deep blue city, then a mixed bag of suburbs (from the""hippie"" Hudson Valley towns to the more angsty anti-tax Long Island), lots of conservative rural areas upstate, etc.",4,0
